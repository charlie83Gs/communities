# Communities

## What is a Community?

A **community** is the foundational organizational unit in the Communities. Think of it as an independent, self-governing group that shares resources, builds trust, and makes decisions together. Each community operates autonomously with its own members, rules, resources, and culture.

Unlike platforms where you join a single organization, Communities enables you to participate in multiple communities simultaneously. Each community you join represents a different circle of sharing and collaboration in your life.

## Community Independence

Each community is **completely independent**:

### Separate Configuration
- Every community defines its own trust thresholds and requirements
- Communities configure what actions require which trust levels
- Settings for one community don't affect others

### Isolated Trust Networks
- Your trust score is **per-community**, not global
- Having high trust in one community doesn't grant you trust in another
- Each community evaluates you based on local relationships
- Example: You might be a "Trusted Member" (25+ trust) in your neighborhood community but a "New Member" (0 trust) in a professional community you just joined

### Independent Resources
- Wealth, pools, and councils exist within single communities
- You cannot share resources across community boundaries
- Each community manages its own resource ecosystem

### Autonomous Governance
- Communities set their own rules and norms
- Each has its own admins and decision-making processes
- Communities can choose different operating philosophies

## Why Independent Communities?

This design reflects real-world social structure. You participate in multiple circles—family, neighborhood, professional networks, hobby groups—each with different norms and levels of intimacy. Communities mirrors this reality rather than forcing everything into a single hierarchy.

**Benefits:**
- **Context-appropriate sharing**: Share differently with neighbors vs. coworkers
- **Safe experimentation**: Try new governance models in one community without affecting others
- **Scalable trust**: Build deep trust in smaller groups rather than shallow trust everywhere
- **Cultural diversity**: Different communities can embody different values

## Multi-Community Membership

You can join and actively participate in multiple communities:

### How It Works
- Accept invites to different communities
- Switch between communities in the navigation
- Each community shows your local trust score
- Your profile displays differently in each community context

### Practical Example
Sarah is a member of three communities:

1. **Hometown Food Coop** (trust score: 45)
   - Long-time member, trusted for reliable food shares
   - Can create pools and moderate forum
   - Active in council leadership

2. **Open Source Developers Network** (trust score: 12)
   - Newer member, building reputation
   - Can share resources and create threads
   - Cannot yet create polls or councils

3. **Neighborhood Tool Library** (trust score: 8)
   - Recently joined through invite link
   - Can view and request resources
   - Working toward trust to share tools

Sarah experiences each community differently based on her local relationships and trust.

## Community Lifecycle

### Creation
1. A user creates a new community
2. Creator automatically becomes the first admin
3. Community starts with default configuration (customizable immediately)
4. Creator can invite initial members

### Bootstrapping
Early communities face a "cold start" problem—no one has trust yet. Admins solve this by:

1. **Inviting initial members** via invite links or direct invites
2. **Granting seed trust** to bootstrap the network (auditable admin-granted trust)
3. **Members awarding trust** to each other as they interact
4. **Trust network emerges** organically from real relationships

This process typically takes a few weeks as members participate and build confidence in each other.

### Growth
Communities grow through:
- **Invite links**: Shareable time-limited URLs for onboarding multiple people
- **Direct invites**: Existing members invite specific users
- **Gradual integration**: New members start with zero trust and earn it through participation

### Maturity
Mature communities develop:
- **Established trust networks**: Core members with high trust scores
- **Active councils**: Specialized groups managing domain-specific work
- **Resource flows**: Regular sharing, pool contributions, and wealth circulation
- **Cultural norms**: Unwritten rules about participation, sharing, and conflict resolution

### Transition and Evolution
Communities can:
- **Change configuration** as they learn what works
- **Adjust trust thresholds** to match community scale and culture
- **Add or modify councils** as needs evolve
- **Revisit governance** through polls and discussion

Some communities may become inactive, merge with others, or spin off sub-communities. The system is designed to support these natural organizational changes.

## Community Types

While all communities use the same technical features, they can serve different purposes:

### Geographic Communities
- **Neighborhood**: Tool sharing, meal trains, local skill exchange
- **Housing Cooperative**: Resource pooling, maintenance coordination
- **Bioregion**: Food networks, water management, emergency response

### Affinity Communities
- **Professional Network**: Skill sharing, collaboration, mentorship
- **Hobby Group**: Equipment sharing, project collaboration
- **Activist Coalition**: Resource pooling for campaigns and actions

### Purpose-Driven Communities
- **Mutual Aid Network**: Emergency support, crisis response
- **Co-op Enterprise**: Production coordination, profit sharing
- **Learning Circle**: Knowledge sharing, peer teaching

The same community might blend multiple types. A neighborhood group might function as geographic, affinity (gardeners), and purpose-driven (emergency preparedness) simultaneously.

## Finding Your Community

Communities exist on a spectrum:

### Open Communities
- Public visibility
- Easy join process (invite links widely shared)
- Lower initial trust requirements
- Focus on broad participation

### Closed Communities
- Private or members-only visibility
- Careful vetting of new members
- Higher trust requirements for actions
- Focus on deep trust and accountability

Most communities fall somewhere in between, adjusting openness based on their needs and values.

## Community Health

Healthy communities share certain patterns:

### Active Trust Network
- Regular trust awards between members
- Distributed trust (not concentrated in a few people)
- Trust awards based on real interaction and reliability

### Resource Circulation
- Wealth being shared and fulfilled
- Pools accumulating and distributing resources
- Councils managing domain-specific work effectively

### Engaged Participation
- Forum discussions and decision-making
- Members voting on polls
- Councils reporting on their activities

### Transparent Accountability
- Clear communication about resource usage
- Visible audit trails for trust and resources
- Conflicts addressed openly through dispute system

The analytics dashboard helps admins and members assess community health across these dimensions.

## When Communities Struggle

Common challenges and responses:

### Low Trust Circulation
**Symptom**: Few members awarding trust, concentrated in admins
**Response**: Encourage participation, create opportunities for members to demonstrate reliability, consider if trust thresholds are too high

### Resource Hoarding
**Symptom**: Wealth sitting unfulfilled, councils not sharing
**Response**: Check if trust requirements are too restrictive, encourage needs expression, create pools to coordinate sharing

### Low Engagement
**Symptom**: Empty forum, no polls, inactive councils
**Response**: Assess if community has clear shared purpose, create engaging initiatives, ensure all voices are heard

### Trust Concentration
**Symptom**: A few members have very high trust, most have very low
**Response**: Encourage diverse trust awards, create opportunities for newer members to contribute, examine if power dynamics are healthy

## Communities as Living Systems

Think of a community not as a fixed structure but as a **living system** that grows, adapts, and sometimes completes its lifecycle. The Communities provides tools and infrastructure, but the community's character emerges from the relationships, values, and practices of its members.

The most successful communities:
- **Start small**: Build deep trust before scaling
- **Communicate clearly**: Discuss norms, expectations, and conflicts openly
- **Iterate**: Adjust configuration based on what you learn
- **Trust the process**: Allow the system to reveal patterns rather than forcing outcomes
- **Honor context**: Different communities need different approaches

Your community is unique. These tools support you in building the specific culture and practices that serve your shared purpose.

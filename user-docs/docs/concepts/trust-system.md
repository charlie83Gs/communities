# Trust System

## Why Trust Instead of Traditional Permissions?

Most platforms use a simple model: administrators grant permissions, regular users get limited access. This creates bottlenecks, concentrates power, and forces communities to choose between open (anyone can do anything) or closed (admins control everything).

The Communities takes a different approach: **earned permissions through peer validation**. Instead of admins deciding who's trustworthy, the community collectively recognizes trust through their relationships and interactions.

## The Philosophy of Trust

### Trust as Social Proof
Your trust score represents **how many community members trust you**. It's not a judgment of your character—it's a measure of your connection and reliability within this specific community context.

- **Trust score of 17** = 17 community members trust you
- **Trust score of 0** = no one has awarded you trust yet (you're new or haven't built relationships)
- **Trust score of 150** = highly connected, long-term member with established reliability

### Trust is Relational
Trust isn't abstract—it's a **relationship**. When Alice awards trust to Bob, she's saying: "I've interacted with Bob, and I believe he'll participate constructively in this community."

This is different from reputation systems where points come from actions. Here, trust comes from people.

### Trust is Local
Your trust exists **per-community**. Being highly trusted in one community says nothing about your standing in another. This mirrors real life—you might be deeply trusted in your neighborhood but unknown in a professional network you just joined.

### Trust is Removable
Crucially, trust can be **withdrawn**. If Alice later decides Bob isn't living up to her confidence, she can remove her trust. This creates accountability—trust must be maintained through ongoing reliable behavior.

## How Trust Works

### Awarding Trust
Once you reach the trust threshold (default: 15), you can award trust to other members. This represents your confidence in their participation and reliability.

**You might award trust to someone because:**
- They reliably fulfill wealth requests you make
- They contribute constructively to forum discussions
- They manage a council transparently and effectively
- They resolve conflicts fairly
- They show up consistently over time

**Trust is not transactional**. You don't award trust because someone gave you something—that would just create reciprocity loops. You award it because you genuinely believe this person will participate well in the community.

### Removing Trust
You can remove trust at any time. Maybe the person:
- Stops participating actively
- Handles a conflict poorly
- Breaks commitments they made
- Changes behavior in ways that reduce your confidence

Removing trust isn't personal—it's updating your assessment based on new information. The person's trust score immediately decreases, which may affect their permissions.

### Admin-Granted Trust
Admins can grant trust to bootstrap new communities or recognize exceptional contribution. This is **separate and auditable**—anyone can see that this trust came from an admin, not from peer relationships.

**Use cases:**
- **Community founding**: First members have no one to trust them yet
- **Recognizing off-platform history**: Someone joins who's well-known in the community
- **Emergency access**: Temporary boost for someone handling a crisis

Admin-granted trust should be used sparingly. Over-reliance undermines the peer-based model.

### Trust Network Effects

Trust creates powerful network effects:

**Early community (10 members):**
- Each member can award trust to up to 9 others
- Maximum possible trust score: 9
- Reaching trust threshold of 15 is impossible from peer trust alone
- Admin-granted trust necessary to bootstrap

**Growing community (50 members):**
- Each member can award trust to up to 49 others
- Maximum possible trust score: 49
- Reaching trust threshold of 15 becomes achievable
- Admin-granted trust still helpful but less critical

**Mature community (200 members):**
- Each member can award trust to up to 199 others
- Maximum possible trust score: 199
- Many members exceed highest thresholds
- Trust network self-sustaining
- Admin-granted trust rarely needed

As communities grow, the trust system becomes more powerful and democratic.

## Trust Levels and Titles

Communities configure **trust titles** that give meaning to trust scores. Default titles:

- **New Member** (0+): Just joined or not yet trusted by anyone
- **Known Member** (10+): Recognized by ~10 members, can share wealth
- **Trusted Member** (25+): Recognized by ~25 members, can create councils
- **Advanced Member** (50+): Highly connected, significant community role
- **Community Expert** (100+): Exceptional trust and contribution
- **Community Benefactor** (200+): Legendary status, possible only in large communities

These are **descriptive, not prescriptive**. Titles show where you are in the community's trust network.

Communities can customize these titles. A 20-person housing coop might set lower thresholds than a 500-person regional network.

## Trust-Based Permissions

Trust scores unlock permissions at configured thresholds:

### Why Trust Thresholds?

Instead of admins manually granting each permission to each person, communities set thresholds that apply to everyone equally. This is:

- **Transparent**: Everyone knows the rules
- **Fair**: Same rules apply to all members
- **Scalable**: No admin bottleneck
- **Democratic**: Community evolves permissions together

### Common Trust Thresholds (Defaults)

- **Award Trust** (15): Create new trust relationships
- **Share Wealth** (10): Publish resources to community
- **Create Forum Threads** (10): Start discussions
- **Create Polls** (15): Initiate community decisions
- **Create Councils** (25): Form specialized working groups
- **Moderate Forum** (30): Full moderation capabilities
- **View Analytics** (20): Access community health data

Each community can adjust these thresholds. A privacy-focused community might raise thresholds. An open community might lower them.

### Trust Thresholds as Culture

Your threshold configuration **encodes community values**:

**High-trust community** (lower thresholds):
- Easier for new members to participate
- More experimental, faster moving
- Relies on social accountability and conflict resolution
- Example: 5 trust to share wealth, 10 to create councils

**Cautious community** (higher thresholds):
- New members observe longer before participating
- More stable, slower to change
- Prevents disruption from unknown members
- Example: 20 trust to share wealth, 40 to create councils

Neither is better—it depends on your community's context and needs.

## Trust vs. Traditional Permissions

### The Dual Permission Model

Communities uses **both** trust-based and role-based permissions:

**Role-based**: Admin explicitly grants a role (e.g., "Forum Manager")
**Trust-based**: User automatically gets the role by reaching threshold (e.g., "Trust Forum Manager")

Both grant the same permission. This hybrid approach combines:
- **Democracy** (trust-based): Anyone can earn access through community validation
- **Flexibility** (role-based): Admins can grant exceptions when needed

### When to Use Each

**Use trust-based for:**
- Default community member progression
- Permissions most members will eventually earn
- Transparent, egalitarian access

**Use role-based for:**
- Temporary responsibilities
- Specialized roles for specific people
- Urgent access needs
- Experimenting with giving someone permissions before they're widely trusted

Most communities rely primarily on trust-based permissions, using role-based grants sparingly.

## Building a Trust Culture

### Trust Takes Time
Don't expect instant trust networks. Healthy trust emerges from:

1. **Participation**: Show up, contribute, engage
2. **Reliability**: Follow through on commitments
3. **Transparency**: Communicate openly about what you're doing
4. **Time**: Demonstrate consistency over weeks and months

### Trust is Gift-Based
You cannot demand trust. You can only create conditions where people freely choose to trust you. This means:

- **Focus on contribution, not recognition**: Do good work, trust follows
- **Accept the pace**: Some members are slower to trust, that's valid
- **Don't game the system**: Asking for trust directly often backfires

### Trust Requires Accountability
Trust and accountability go together:

- **Track your commitments**: If you offer resources, fulfill requests
- **Communicate proactively**: If something changes, let people know
- **Accept feedback**: If someone removes trust, reflect on why
- **Repair breaches**: When you mess up, acknowledge and make it right

### Trust Diversity Matters
Healthy communities have:

- **Distributed trust**: Not concentrated in a few "popular" members
- **New member pathways**: Clear ways for newcomers to build trust
- **Multiple trust contexts**: People trusted for different strengths (reliability, expertise, mediation, etc.)

Monitor your community's trust distribution. If most members have very low trust and a few have very high, investigate why.

## Trust Transparency and Auditing

All trust actions are logged and visible:

### Trust History
Every trust award and removal is recorded:
- Who awarded/removed trust
- When it happened
- Current trust score after the change

### Admin Trust Grants
Admin-granted trust is tracked separately:
- Which admin granted it
- How much trust was granted
- When it was granted
- Any modifications to that grant

This transparency prevents trust manipulation and helps communities understand their trust networks.

### Viewing Trust
Depending on community configuration:
- Members may see who has trusted them
- Members may see who someone else has trusted
- Members may see trust history and changes

This visibility creates accountability and helps members understand the trust network.

## Trust Challenges and Solutions

### "I'm stuck at low trust"
**Why this happens:**
- Not participating in visible ways
- New to community (patience needed)
- Community is small (fewer possible trust sources)
- Participating in ways that don't build relationships

**How to address:**
- Contribute to forum discussions
- Reliably fulfill wealth requests
- Participate in councils or initiatives
- Show up consistently over time
- Ask for feedback on how to build trust

### "Someone removed their trust"
**Why this happens:**
- They're updating their assessment based on your recent behavior
- They misunderstood something (communication needed)
- You broke a commitment or violated norms
- They're leaving the community and removing all trusts

**How to respond:**
- Reflect honestly on your recent participation
- Consider reaching out to ask for feedback (not to argue)
- Make amends if you've caused harm
- Accept that not everyone will trust you, and that's okay

### "Trust feels clique-ish"
**Why this happens:**
- Existing members know each other better
- New members haven't had time to build relationships
- Community isn't creating opportunities for new member integration

**How to address:**
- Create explicit onboarding practices
- Run initiatives that mix new and established members
- Ensure new member voices are heard in forums
- Monitor trust distribution and address concentration

### "We're giving too much admin-granted trust"
**Why this happens:**
- Avoiding the discomfort of making people wait
- Wanting to move fast
- Unclear norms about when admin-grants are appropriate

**How to address:**
- Establish clear guidelines for admin-granted trust
- Let the organic trust network develop
- Reduce admin grants over time as community matures
- Review and potentially reduce admin-granted trust periodically

## Trust as Collective Intelligence

The trust system is a form of **collective sense-making**. No single person decides who's trustworthy—the community collectively recognizes trust through thousands of individual assessments.

This creates emergent wisdom:
- People who consistently contribute earn broad trust
- People who violate norms lose trust
- Edge cases (amazing contributor but poor communicator) surface for community discussion
- Trust patterns reveal community health and culture

**Trust the process.** The system will reveal patterns you didn't design. Some of these patterns may surprise you. Often, they reflect truths about the community that centralized control would have masked.

## Trust and Gift Economy

Trust is the **foundation of the gift economy** that Communities enables. Traditional markets use money as trust replacement—you don't need to trust the seller because payment is guaranteed.

Gift economies require actual trust:
- **I share my tools** because I trust you'll return them
- **You help with my project** because you trust the community will support you later
- **The council manages resources** because we trust they'll use them well

The trust system makes gift economy viable at scale by creating **visible, accountable, emergent trust networks**.

Without trust, you're just trading resources through a complicated interface. With trust, you're building a community that can coordinate without markets or hierarchy.

## Advanced Trust Concepts

### Council Trust
Councils (community actors) also have trust scores, representing community confidence in their mission and operations. This allows:

- Communities to express support for council work
- Councils to earn permissions based on community backing
- Visible accountability for council effectiveness

Council trust works the same as member trust—members can award and remove trust from councils.

### Trust-Based Dispute Resolution
Communities can configure that only trusted members (or councils with sufficient trust) can mediate disputes. This ensures that conflict resolution is handled by people the community broadly trusts.

### Trust Decay (Planned)
Future versions may implement trust decay—trust scores gradually decrease over time unless renewed. This ensures trust reflects current relationships and activity, not just past history.

This would require active community participation to maintain trust, rather than trust becoming a permanent status.

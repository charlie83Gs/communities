# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Communities and how it works.

## Getting Started

### What is Communities?

Communities is a community resource sharing platform built on gift economy principles. It enables communities to manage shared resources, build trust relationships, and make collaborative decisions—all without monetary transactions.

### Do I need to pay to use Communities?

No. Communities is designed for gift-based sharing, not monetary exchange. There are no fees, payments, or currencies involved.

### How do I join?

You typically need an invitation from an existing community member. See [Joining a Community](getting-started/joining-community.md) for details.

### What's a "community" in Communities?

A community is an independent group with its own members, resources, and governance. Communities can be geographic (neighborhoods), affinity-based (co-ops), or purpose-driven (mutual aid networks).

### Can I be in multiple communities?

Yes! You can join multiple communities. Each has its own trust score for you and operates independently.

## Trust System

### What is trust and why does it matter?

Trust is Communities's permission system. Your trust score = the number of community members who trust you. Higher trust unlocks more abilities. [Learn more](getting-started/understanding-trust.md)

### How do I gain trust?

Participate authentically:
- Fulfill commitments
- Contribute to discussions
- Share resources
- Help others
- Show up consistently

Trust builds over time through genuine relationships.

### What if I never gain trust?

Give it 2-3 months of active participation. If you're still not gaining trust:
- Ask for feedback from members
- Reflect on your participation style
- Consider if this community is the right fit

### Can I lose trust?

Yes. Members can remove trust they previously awarded if they no longer trust you. This immediately decreases your score and may remove permissions.

### What's the difference between trust and roles?

Trust is peer-awarded (community members give it). Roles are admin-assigned (like "admin" or "moderator"). You get permissions if you meet either threshold.

### Why can't I do something I could do yesterday?

Your trust score may have decreased (someone removed trust), or the community changed trust thresholds. Check your current trust level in your profile.

## Resource Sharing

### What can I share?

Anything! Physical products, services, skills, space, time, knowledge—anything you're willing to give to the community.

### Do I have to share?

No. Sharing is voluntary. Share what you can, when you can.

### What if I have nothing to share?

Everyone has something to offer:
- Your time and attention
- Your perspective and ideas
- Your labor and skills
- Your presence and support

Gift economy doesn't require material wealth.

### Can I request resources?

Yes! All community members can browse and request resources, even with zero trust. Trust thresholds only apply to **sharing** resources, not requesting them.

### What if my request is rejected?

That's okay. The owner has the right to decline. Try:
- Requesting something else
- Waiting and requesting again later
- Understanding their reasons
- Building more trust first

### Do I have to give to receive?

No. Gift economy is about circulation, not reciprocity. You receive because others choose to give, not because you've "earned" it through giving.

### What if someone doesn't fulfill their commitment?

Try direct communication first. If that doesn't work, you can:
- Create a dispute for mediation
- Stop trusting them (removing their permissions)
- Seek community support

## Permissions and Access

### Why can't I create threads/polls/councils?

You may not have reached the required trust threshold. Check:
1. Your current trust score (in your profile)
2. Required threshold (in Community Settings)
3. How to gain more trust

### I'm an admin but still can't do something. Why?

Some features require specific roles (like "forum_manager" for moderation) or may be disabled at the community level. Check:
- Community feature flags
- Your assigned roles
- Trust thresholds (they apply to admins too for some actions)

### Can admins do everything?

Admins have broad permissions but some features require:
- Trust thresholds (even for admins)
- Specific roles (forum_manager, poll_creator, etc.)
- Being a member of councils/pools

### What's the difference between viewer and action permissions?

- **Viewer permissions**: What you can *see* (view wealth, view analytics, etc.)
- **Action permissions**: What you can *do* (share wealth, create polls, award trust)

Different thresholds control each type.

## Councils and Pools

### What's the difference between councils and pools?

- **Councils**: Groups of people managing resources and initiatives
- **Pools**: Collections of resources for collective distribution

Councils often manage pools, but they're separate features.

### Can anyone create a council or pool?

Creating councils typically requires trust ≥ 25 (default). Creating pools requires being a council manager. Check your community's thresholds.

### How do I join a council?

Ask a council manager to invite you, or request membership if the council allows applications.

### Can I leave a council?

Yes, anytime. Go to the council page and click "Leave Council."

## Value Recognition

### What are value recognition units?

Units that track economic contributions to the community. They're for appreciation and visibility, **not** for access to resources.

### Do I need value recognition to access resources?

**No!** Value recognition does NOT gate access to wealth, councils, pools, or any other features. Trust thresholds control access, not contribution scores.

### Why track contributions if they don't unlock anything?

To:
- Make contributions visible and appreciated
- Help communities understand flow patterns
- Recognize members who contribute a lot
- Celebrate reciprocity and gifting

### Can I game the system?

Communities can review and dispute contributions. Gaming damages your trust and reputation, which *does* affect access.

## Skills and Endorsements

### What's the difference between skills, trust, and value recognition?

- **Skills**: Specific capabilities you have (plumbing, gardening, teaching)
- **Trust**: Community confidence in you (unlocks permissions)
- **Value Recognition**: Appreciation for contributions (doesn't unlock permissions)

They're separate systems for different purposes.

### Do I need endorsements to offer services?

No. You can share service-based wealth regardless of endorsements. Endorsements just show community validation of your skills.

## Technical Questions

### Can I use Communities on mobile?

Yes, Communities is web-based and works on mobile browsers. A native app may be developed in the future.

### Is my data private?

Communities can configure privacy settings. Generally:
- Your profile is visible to community members
- Your contributions depend on your privacy settings
- Your trust awards may be visible or private (community setting)
- Messages are private between participants

### Can I delete my account?

Yes. Go to **Profile Settings** → **Delete Account**. Your data will be removed within 30 days.

### What happens to my data if I leave a community?

Your contributions remain visible (attributed to you), but you lose access to community resources and can't add new content.

## Community Management

### How do I start my own community?

See [Creating a Community](admin/creating-community.md) for the complete guide.

### Can I change community settings later?

Yes! Admins can adjust trust thresholds, feature flags, and other settings anytime. Changes take effect immediately.

### What if my community has toxic members?

Admins can:
- Remove members
- Assign moderation roles
- Adjust trust thresholds
- Enable dispute resolution
- Create community guidelines

### How do I handle disputes?

Communities includes a built-in [dispute resolution system](features/disputes.md) with transparent mediation.

## Philosophy and Culture

### Why no money?

Gift economy enables coordination without monetary logic. It:
- Builds relationships instead of transactions
- Values contribution over accumulation
- Creates abundance through sharing
- Reduces inequality and builds solidarity

### Isn't this just barter?

No. Barter is direct exchange ("I'll give you X if you give me Y"). Gift economy is circulation—you give because you can, receive because you need, with no expectation of direct reciprocity.

### What if people take advantage?

Communities self-regulate through:
- Trust system (lose trust = lose permissions)
- Transparency (all actions are visible)
- Dispute resolution (mediation for conflicts)
- Community accountability (members watch out for each other)

### How does this scale?

Through federated communities:
- Many small communities with high trust
- Inter-community relationships develop over time
- Shared infrastructure, autonomous governance
- Network effects without centralization

### Can this replace money entirely?

For some communities, yes. For others, it supplements monetary systems. Communities doesn't require rejecting money—it just doesn't use it for internal coordination.

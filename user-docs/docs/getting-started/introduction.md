# Introduction to Communities

Welcome to Communities! This guide will help you understand what Communities is and how it can benefit your community.

## What is a Gift Economy?

Communities is built on **gift economy** principles—a system where goods and services flow without monetary exchange. Instead of buying and selling:

- Members **share** what they have
- Members **request** what they need
- **Trust** replaces money as the coordination mechanism
- **Contribution** is recognized and valued by the community

## How is Communities Different?

### Traditional Platforms vs. Communities

| Traditional Platforms | Communities |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Monetary transactions | Gift-based sharing |
| Centralized control | Community governance |
| Admin-only permissions | Trust-based permissions |
| Opaque decision-making | Transparent processes |
| Individual ownership | Collective stewardship |

## Key Concepts

### Communities

Communities are independent groups with their own:

- Members and roles
- Resources and wealth
- Trust thresholds
- Governance rules
- Decision-making processes

You can be a member of multiple communities, each with different values and structures.

### Trust

Trust is the foundation of Communities:

- **Trust Score**: Number of community members who trust you
- **Trust Thresholds**: Minimum trust needed for different actions
- **Trust-Based Permissions**: Unlock abilities by gaining community trust
- **Trust Awards**: Members can give or remove trust based on their experience

### Wealth Sharing

"Wealth" in Communities means any resource you can share:

- Physical products (food, clothing, tools)
- Services (skills, labor, knowledge)
- Space (housing, workspaces, land)
- Time and attention

### Councils

Councils are specialized groups that:

- Manage specific resources or domains
- Create initiatives for the community
- Have their own trust system
- Can distribute resources to members

### Pools

Pools aggregate resources for:

- Collective projects
- Shared planning
- Community initiatives
- Emergency reserves

## The Communities Journey

Here's a typical path for new members:

1. **Join**: Accept an invite or request to join a community
2. **Observe**: Participate in discussions, learn community norms
3. **Contribute**: Share resources, help others, participate actively
4. **Earn Trust**: Community members award you trust
5. **Unlock Abilities**: Higher trust grants more permissions
6. **Lead**: Create councils, manage pools, mediate disputes

## Who is Communities For?

Communities works well for:

- **Intentional Communities**: Co-housing, ecovillages, communes
- **Cooperatives**: Worker co-ops, housing co-ops, food co-ops
- **Mutual Aid Networks**: Supporting each other through sharing
- **Time Banks**: Exchanging services without money
- **Community Land Trusts**: Collective land stewardship
- **Transition Towns**: Building local resilience
- **Any group** coordinating resource sharing

## Core Values

Communities embodies:

- **Abundance Thinking**: There's enough for everyone when we share
- **Peer Trust**: Community members validate each other
- **Transparency**: Actions are visible and auditable
- **Autonomy**: Communities set their own rules
- **Participation**: Everyone can contribute meaningfully
- **Equity**: Access based on trust, not money or status

## What Communities Is Not

To set clear expectations:

- **Not a marketplace**: No buying or selling
- **Not a barter system**: No direct exchange required
- **Not cryptocurrency**: No tokens or blockchain
- **Not centrally controlled**: Communities govern themselves
- **Not one-size-fits-all**: Highly configurable to your values

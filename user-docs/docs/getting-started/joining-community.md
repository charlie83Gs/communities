# Joining a Community

Learn how to find and join communities in Communities.

## Ways to Join

There are several ways to join a community:

1. **Invitation Link** - Click a link shared by a member (most common)
2. **Invitation Code** - Enter a code provided by a member
3. **Direct Invite** - Accept an invitation sent to your account
4. **Browse Communities** - Request to join public communities (if enabled)

## Joining with an Invitation Link

The easiest way to join is through an invitation link:

### Step 1: Receive the Link

A community member shares a link that looks like:
```
https://share-app.example.com/invite/abc123xyz
```

### Step 2: Click the Link

- If you have an account: You'll be logged in and see the invitation
- If you don't have an account: You'll be prompted to create one first

### Step 3: Review the Community

Before accepting, review:

- **Community Name** and description
- **Member Count** - How large is the community?
- **Trust Thresholds** - What trust levels unlock which features?
- **Community Values** - What principles guide this community?

### Step 4: Accept the Invitation

Click **Accept Invitation** to become a member.

!!! success "Welcome!"
    You're now a community member! You'll start with a trust score of 0 and can begin participating right away.

## Joining with an Invitation Code

If you received a code instead of a link:

1. Log into Communities
2. Go to **Communities** → **Join Community**
3. Select **Use Invitation Code**
4. Enter the code (e.g., `GROW2024`)
5. Review the community details
6. Click **Join**

## Accepting a Direct Invitation

If a member invited you directly:

1. Log into Communities
2. Check your **Notifications** or **Dashboard**
3. You'll see a pending invitation
4. Click **View Invitation**
5. Review the community
6. Click **Accept** or **Decline**

## Browsing Public Communities

Some Communities instances allow browsing:

1. Go to **Communities** → **Browse**
2. See a list of public communities
3. Filter by:
   - **Location** (if communities are location-based)
   - **Type** (intentional community, co-op, mutual aid, etc.)
   - **Size** (number of members)
4. Click a community to learn more
5. Click **Request to Join**
6. Wait for admin approval

!!! note "Approval Required"
    Public communities typically require admin approval. You'll be notified when your request is reviewed.

## Your First Days

After joining a community:

### 1. Complete Your Profile

- Add a profile picture
- Write a brief bio
- List your skills
- Set your privacy preferences

### 2. Introduce Yourself

Many communities have:
- Welcome forum threads
- Introduction channels
- New member orientations

Share a bit about yourself:
- What brings you to this community?
- What are you hoping to share or find?
- What skills or interests do you have?

### 3. Observe and Learn

Before diving in:

- **Read community guidelines** (if posted)
- **Browse the forum** to understand norms
- **Look at shared resources** to see what's typical
- **Check community announcements** for important info
- **Note trust thresholds** to understand the permission system

### 4. Start Participating

Begin building trust by:

- **Responding to forum discussions** thoughtfully
- **Requesting resources** you genuinely need
- **Sharing something small** to test the waters
- **Attending community events** (if any)

## Understanding Your New Member Status

As a new member (trust score 0):

### What You CAN Do

✅ View shared wealth and resources
✅ Participate in forum discussions
✅ Vote on polls
✅ View community information
✅ See other members

### What You CAN'T Do Yet

❌ Award trust to others (typically requires trust ≥ 15)
❌ Share your own resources (typically requires trust ≥ 10)
❌ Create polls (typically requires trust ≥ 15)
❌ Create councils (typically requires trust ≥ 25)

!!! tip "Thresholds Vary"
    These are default thresholds. Your community may have different settings. Check **Community Settings** to see your community's thresholds.

## Earning Your First Trust

Trust is earned through authentic participation:

### Quick Wins

1. **Fulfill requests reliably** - If you request something, follow through
2. **Contribute to discussions** - Share knowledge and ask good questions
3. **Help others** - Answer questions, offer resources
4. **Show up consistently** - Regular participation builds relationships

### Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Observe, introduce yourself, participate in discussions
- **Week 3-4**: Request a small resource, contribute to forum
- **Month 2-3**: Active participation, start receiving trust awards
- **Month 3-6**: Reach first trust thresholds, unlock new abilities

!!! note "Patience Matters"
    Trust builds slowly. Don't expect immediate trust awards. Focus on authentic participation, and trust will follow.

## Red Flags to Avoid

Don't do these things as a new member:

❌ **Trust trading**: "I'll trust you if you trust me"
❌ **Demanding trust**: "Why doesn't anyone trust me?"
❌ **Gaming the system**: Making requests just to seem active
❌ **Over-promising**: Offering more than you can deliver
❌ **Being pushy**: Aggressive requests or expectations

## Joining Multiple Communities

You can be a member of multiple communities:

- Each has its own **trust score** for you
- Each has its own **rules and norms**
- Each has its own **resources and members**
- You can participate in all simultaneously

### Managing Multiple Memberships

- Use the **community switcher** to navigate
- Check your **dashboard** to see all communities
- Set **notification preferences** for each community
- Be clear about which community you're active in when participating

## Leaving a Community

If you decide a community isn't right for you:

1. Go to **Community Settings**
2. Click **Leave Community**
3. Confirm you want to leave

### What Happens When You Leave

- You lose access to community resources
- Your trust score in that community is archived
- Your contributions remain visible (but you can't add more)
- You can rejoin later if invited again

!!! warning "Leaving is Permanent"
    You can only rejoin if invited again. Consider taking a break instead of leaving completely.

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or confused:

- **Ask in the forum** - Community members are usually helpful
- **Contact a community admin** - Look for members with admin badge
- **Read the community guidelines** - Often answers common questions
- **Check the FAQ** - General Communities questions

## Common Questions

### How do I know if an invitation is legitimate?

- Check who sent it (do you know them?)
- Verify the community name matches what you expect
- Look at the member count and activity
- Trust your instincts

### Can I join a community without an invitation?

Only if the community is set to public and allows browsing. Most communities require invitations for privacy.

### What if I don't gain trust?

- Give it time (at least 2-3 months of active participation)
- Ask for feedback from trusted members
- Reflect on your participation style
- Consider if this community is the right fit

### Can I change communities later?

Yes! You can leave and join other communities. Your trust and participation are specific to each community.

### What if the community has values I disagree with?

Communities are autonomous. If you disagree with core values or practices, it might not be the right fit. Consider:
- Discussing concerns respectfully
- Proposing changes through governance processes
- Finding a different community that aligns better

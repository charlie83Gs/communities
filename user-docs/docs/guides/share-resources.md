### 4. Fill in Sharing Details

#### Title (Required)
Write a brief, clear description:
- ✓ "Fresh organic tomatoes from my garden"

Organically grown in my backyard garden. Available for pickup
from my porch anytime - I'll leave them in a box by the door.
Please return the box when you're done.
```

**Example - Service:**

### 5. Set Quantity and Duration

#### Units Available (Required)
How much are you sharing?

**Objects:** Count or quantity
- "5 kg" (tomatoes)
- "1" (bicycle)
- "20 books"

**Services:** Hours or sessions
- "10 hours" (tutoring)
- "5 sessions" (massage)
- "20 hours" (plumbing work)

**Minimum: 1 unit**

#### Max Units Per Person (Optional)
Limit how much one person can request:
- Helps distribute to more people
- "Max 2 kg per person" means 5kg can serve at least 2 people
- Leave empty for no limit

#### Duration
Choose how long this offer lasts:

**Unlimited** (default):
- Share stays active until all units are taken or you cancel it
- Good for: Durable goods, ongoing services

**Time-bound:**
- Set an end date
- Good for: Perishable items, temporary availability
- Example: "Fresh tomatoes available until Friday"

### 6. Configure Service Recurrence (Services Only)

If you're sharing a service you can provide regularly, enable **Recurrent Service**:

**How it works:**
- System automatically adds units on a schedule
- You don't have to manually update availability
- Perfect for ongoing commitments

**Settings:**

**Frequency:**
- **Weekly** - Units replenish every 7 days
- **Monthly** - Units replenish every month

**Replenish Amount:**
- How many units to add each cycle
- Example: 10 hours replenished monthly

**Example:**
```
Service: Electrical Consulting
Starting Units: 10 hours
Recurrence: Monthly
Replenish Amount: 10 hours

Result: Every month, 10 hours are automatically added to
your available hours. You're committing to providing this
service indefinitely.
```

!!! warning "Use Recurrence Responsibly"
    Only enable recurrence if you can maintain the commitment. It's better to manually share when you have capacity than to auto-commit and disappoint people.

_[Screenshot placeholder: Incoming requests panel]_

### Responding to Requests

For each request, you can:

**Accept:**
1. Click **Accept** on the request
2. Use the private message thread to coordinate:
   - When and where to meet
   - Pickup or delivery details
   - Any special instructions
3. Complete the exchange
4. Mark as fulfilled when done

**Reject:**
1. Click **Reject** if the request doesn't work for you
2. No explanation required (you decide autonomously)
3. Units return to available pool

**Message First:**
1. Ask clarifying questions via private messages
2. Discuss timing or conditions
3. Then accept or reject based on the conversation

!!! tip "Trust Your Judgment"
    You're never obligated to accept a request. Share with people you feel comfortable helping, when it works for you.

_[Screenshot placeholder: Request detail with accept/reject/message options]_

### Private Messaging

**Message features:**

## Common Scenarios

### Sharing Fresh Produce

**Best practices:**
1. Set time-bound duration (produce spoils)
2. Use realistic quantities
3. Include pickup instructions in description
4. Set max units per person to distribute fairly
5. Be responsive to requests (food is time-sensitive)

**Example:**
- Item: Tomatoes
- Title: "Heirloom tomatoes, ripe today"
- Quantity: 10 kg, max 3 kg per person
- Duration: Until Saturday
- Description: "Pick up from porch, box by door"

### Offering Recurring Services

**Best practices:**
1. Start with modest hours to test demand
2. Enable recurrent service if you can commit
3. Be clear about your availability
4. Use max units to prevent one person monopolizing
5. Build reputation through consistent follow-through

**Example:**
- Item: Tutoring
- Title: "Math tutoring, grades 6-12"
- Quantity: 10 hours, max 2 hours per person
- Recurrence: Weekly, 10 hours
- Description: "15 years teaching experience, weekday evenings"

### Lending Tools

**Best practices:**
1. Describe condition honestly
2. Set return expectations in description
3. Consider limiting duration (borrow time)
4. Include care instructions if relevant
5. Trust matters—you might want higher trust for valuable tools

**Example:**
- Item: Power Drill
- Title: "DeWalt cordless drill with bits"
- Quantity: 1, max 7 days
- Description: "Good condition, includes battery and charger. Please return clean and in working order."

### One-Time Offers

**Best practices:**
1. Use time-bound duration for urgency
2. Don't over-commit—share what you have
3. Be prompt in responding to requests
4. Update or cancel if circumstances change

**Example:**
- Item: Moving Boxes
- Title: "30 cardboard moving boxes, free"
- Quantity: 30, max 10 per person
- Duration: Until next weekend
- Description: "Used once, still sturdy. Take what you need."

## Tips for Successful Sharing

- Confirm details (time, place)

✓ **Build on positive exchanges**
- People who had good experiences will trust you more

## Troubleshooting

### "No one is requesting my share"

**Possible reasons:**
- Description isn't clear or appealing
- No photo (add one!)
- Item isn't needed right now (timing)
- Price/quantity isn't attractive (max units too low?)
- Trust threshold too high (if you set custom threshold)

**Try:**
- Improve description and add photo
- Mention it in community forum
- Ask if people need this type of item
- Adjust quantity or duration
- Be patient—needs vary over time

### "I got too many requests at once"

**Options:**
1. Accept the first few and reject the rest
2. Use messages to prioritize based on need
3. Ask people to explain their need
4. Split quantities if possible
5. Note for next time: set lower max units per person

### "I can't fulfill what I promised"

**If something changes:**
1. Message affected requesters immediately
2. Explain the situation honestly
3. Cancel accepted requests if necessary
4. Mark the share as cancelled
5. Learn for next time (start conservative)

!!! warning "Reputation Matters"
    Unfulfilled commitments damage trust. Only accept requests you can honor. It's better to reject upfront than to accept and fail to deliver.

### "Someone isn't following through on pickup"

**Steps:**
1. Send a polite reminder message
2. Give them a few days to respond
3. If they ghost, cancel the request
4. Consider removing trust if pattern repeats
5. Make the item available to others

## Advanced: Trust-Capped Wealth

For valuable or risky items, you can set custom trust requirements:

**How it works:**
- Set trust threshold higher than community default
- Example: "Power tools require 30 trust" (vs default 10)
- Everyone sees the item, but only qualified members can request

**When to use:**
- Expensive equipment
- Items requiring skill to use safely
- Things you want returned in good condition
- Personal items you're protective of

**How to set:**
- In wealth creation form, look for "Minimum Trust" field
- Set higher than community's `minTrustForWealth` (usually 10)
- Protects both you and the item

!!! note "Use Sparingly"
    High trust requirements limit access. Use for genuinely valuable/risky items, not to gatekeep unnecessarily.

## What Builds Trust Through Sharing

Sharing resources—especially consistently—is one of the fastest ways to gain trust:

**Trust-building behaviors:**
- ✓ Share regularly (even small things)
- ✓ Respond promptly to requests
- ✓ Honor all commitments
- ✓ Communicate clearly
- ✓ Be generous with quantities
- ✓ Help newcomers access resources
- ✓ Follow through on services
- ✓ Return borrowed items in good condition (when you're the requester)

**After positive exchanges:**
- Recipients often award you trust
- Your reputation grows in the community
- You unlock requesting permissions (if you didn't have them)
- People feel confident requesting from you

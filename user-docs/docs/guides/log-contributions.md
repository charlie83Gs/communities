# How to Log Contributions

This guide walks you through the value recognition system and tracking your contributions.

## Before You Start

**What you'll need:**
- Community membership
- Understanding of value recognition vs. trust
- Awareness that value recognition does NOT gate access to features

**Time required:** Automatic (contributions tracked from wealth sharing)

## Quick Start

The value recognition system makes all forms of valuable work visible—from care work to resource sharing to community building. Unlike market systems that impose universal pricing, your community democratically decides what to value and how much. Value recognition is for appreciation and visibility, NOT for feature access (which remains trust-based).

## Understanding Value Recognition

### What Value Recognition Is

**Purpose:**
- Make invisible work visible
- Enable community appreciation
- Track contribution patterns
- Inform (not determine) trust decisions

**What it is NOT:**
- ❌ Currency (cannot be spent or traded)
- ❌ Access control (doesn't gate features)
- ❌ Required for requesting resources (trust does that)
- ❌ Competition or ranking system

### Value Recognition vs. Trust

**Two separate dimensions:**

**Trust (Relationship-Based):**
- Peer relationships and confidence
- Explicit trust endorsements
- Gates access to features
- Social capital and permissions

**Value Recognition (Contribution-Based):**
- Recognized contributions to community
- Tracked activities
- Visibility and appreciation
- Informational, not transactional

**Example scenarios:**

**High Recognition + High Trust = Alice**
- Contributes care work, sharing, community building
- Trusted by many members
- Full access + recognized and appreciated

**High Recognition + Low Trust = Bob**
- Logs many contributions but behaviors raise concerns
- Community doesn't trust him despite activity
- Limited access (trust determines this, not recognition)

**Low Recognition + High Trust = Carol**
- Limited capacity to contribute (disability, crisis, caregiving)
- Deeply trusted through relationships
- Full access (trust allows receiving even with low recognition)

!!! important "Access is Trust-Based"
    You can request resources, create councils, and access features based on TRUST, not value recognition. Recognition is pure appreciation.

### How Contributions are Tracked

**Automatic from wealth sharing (primary):**
- When you share wealth that gets fulfilled, contribution auto-created
- No manual logging needed
- System has proof of the exchange
- Auto-verified immediately

**Peer recognition grants (limited):**
- Other members can grant you recognition for work they witnessed
- Monthly limits prevent gaming
- Captures work outside wealth system
- Auto-verified (trust-based)

**NO self-reporting:**
- System simplified to remove self-reported contributions
- Everything flows from verified sources
- Reduces gaming and verification burden

## Automatic Contribution Tracking

### Wealth Fulfillment Creates Contributions

**How it works:**

1. **You share wealth** (e.g., "Garden Tools" for 3 days)
2. **Someone requests and you fulfill** the request
3. **System automatically creates contribution**:
   - Item: Garden Tools
   - Units: 3 (days)
   - Value: 3 × item's value = total contribution value
   - Status: auto_verified
   - Source: wealth_fulfillment

**No action needed:** Sharing IS contributing.

**Example flow:**
```
You share: "10 hours of tutoring"
Member A requests: 2 hours
You fulfill → Contribution: 2 hours tutoring (auto-created)
Member B requests: 3 hours
You fulfill → Contribution: 3 hours tutoring (auto-created)
Total recognition: 5 hours of tutoring
```

### What Gets Tracked

**Services:**
- All service hours you provide through wealth shares
- Tutoring, repairs, care work, teaching, etc.
- Measured in hours or sessions
- Value per unit based on item's configured value

**Objects:**
- Items you share that get used
- Loans measured in item-days
- Food measured in portions or kilograms
- Value based on item's configured value

**Pool contributions:**
- Resources you contribute to pools
- Tracked when council confirms contribution
- Shows your support of collective resources

## Peer Recognition Grants

### How Peer Recognition Works

**Any trusted member can grant you recognition:**
- For work they witnessed
- Limited to prevent gaming
- Captures contributions outside wealth system
- Immediate and auto-verified

**Monthly limits:**
- Each member can grant up to 20 value units per month (community default)
- Can't grant to same person more than 3 times per month
- Must include description of what was done

### When to Grant Peer Recognition

**Good reasons:**
- Emotional support someone provided
- Community building activities
- Informal help you received
- Care work not tracked in wealth system
- Event organizing, welcoming newcomers
- Conflict mediation
- Any valuable work not captured elsewhere

**Example grants:**
```
Alice grants 10 units to Bob:
"Bob provided emotional support during my difficult week.
His presence and listening made a huge difference."

Carol grants 5 units to Dave:
"Dave organized the community potluck, handled all logistics,
made everyone feel welcome. Real community building work."
```

### How to Grant Peer Recognition

1. **Navigate to member's profile**
2. **Click "Grant Recognition" button**
3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Value units (1-20, within your monthly limit)
   - Description of their contribution (required)
4. **Submit**

**What happens:**
- Contribution created immediately
- They receive notification
- Shows on their contribution profile
- Counts toward your monthly limit

## Item Value Calibration

### How Communities Set Values

**Democratic process:**
- Communities review item values quarterly
- Propose adjustments based on:
  - Scarcity/abundance of contributions
  - Effort required vs current valuation
  - Community priorities and needs
- Discuss and decide collectively
- Changes apply to future contributions only

**Example calibration:**
```
Item: Elder Care (service)
Current: 10 units/hour
Proposed: 15 units/hour

Reasoning:
- Elder care becoming scarce
- Aging population with growing needs
- Current caregivers report high effort/impact
- Community values intergenerational care highly

Decision: Community poll (78% support)
Effective: Next quarter

Result: Future elder care contributions worth 15 units/hour
```

### Why Calibration Matters

**Community sovereignty:**
- Each community decides what to value
- No imposed market values
- Democratic calibration process
- Reflects community priorities

**Making invisible work visible:**
- Can increase value of undervalued work
- Care work, emotional labor, community building
- Counters market distortions
- Names what matters

**All items start equal:**
- Default 10 units per standard unit
- Communities discover what they value
- No market assumptions imported

## Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

### Pattern Detection

**System flags:**
- Unusual volume of peer grants
- Grants concentrated in small groups
- Potential gaming patterns

**Response:**
- Human review, not automatic penalties
- Community conversation
- Address socially
- Maintain integrity through transparency

### Dispute Process

**If contribution seems wrong:**
- Either party can mark as disputed
- Used for error correction
- Council or mediator reviews
- Decision documented
- Pattern of disputes reduces trust

**Not for:**
- Policing every contribution
- Aggressive verification
- Assuming bad faith
- Creating surveillance

## Troubleshooting

### "Why aren't my contributions showing up?"

**Check:**
1. Did you fulfill wealth shares? (auto-creates contributions)
2. Did someone grant you peer recognition? (check notifications)
3. Privacy settings might be hiding from you (unlikely)
4. Contact admin if system issue

### "Can I log contributions manually?"

**No:**
- Self-reported contributions removed
- Reduces gaming and verification burden
- All contributions from verified sources:
  - Wealth fulfillment (automatic)
  - Peer recognition (trust-gated)

**Alternatives:**
- Share wealth (gets tracked automatically)
- Ask others to grant peer recognition (if they witnessed work)

### "My contribution value seems wrong"

**Possible reasons:**
1. Item value calibrated after your contribution (uses snapshot)
2. Units calculated differently than you expected
3. Error in contribution creation

**What to do:**
- Check item's current value
- Review contribution details
- Dispute if genuinely wrong
- Ask admin to investigate

### "Why can't I grant peer recognition?"

**Requirements:**
- Trust score ≥ 10 (default threshold)
- Haven't exceeded monthly limit (20 units default)
- Haven't granted to same person 3+ times this month

**Solutions:**
- Build trust to threshold
- Wait for next month if at limit
- Grant to different people

## Next Steps

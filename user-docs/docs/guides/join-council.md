# How to Join a Council

This guide walks you through finding, joining, and participating in councils.

## Before You Start

**What you'll need:**

- Interest in contributing to specific community functions

**Time required:**
- Finding councils: 5-10 minutes
- Requesting membership: 5 minutes
- Building council trust: Ongoing

## Quick Start

Councils are specialized groups within your community that coordinate specific functions—food distribution, tool sharing, event planning, resource management. Joining a council means contributing your time and skills to help these functions run smoothly.

## Understanding Councils

### What Councils Do

Councils serve as **specialized community actors**:

**Resource Management:**

**Coordination:**
- Organize events and initiatives
- Plan community functions
- Coordinate volunteers
- Execute community decisions

**Specialized Functions:**
- Food distribution council
- Tool library council
- Community garden council
- Events planning council
- Mutual aid council

### Council vs. Community Membership

**Community membership:**

- Access to community resources
- Vote in polls
- Share and request wealth

**Council membership:**

- Additional permissions within council scope

**You can be:**

### 3. Identify Good Fits

**Choose councils where you can:**
- ✓ Contribute specific skills
- ✓ Commit time regularly
- ✓ Learn and grow
- ✓ Work well with existing members
- ✓ Align with council's values

**Avoid joining if:**
- ✗ Just want the permissions
- ✗ Can't commit time
- ✗ Don't care about the mission
- ✗ Only joining for access to resources

!!! tip "Quality Over Quantity"
    Better to actively participate in one council than to nominally join several. Focus your energy where you can make real impact.

coordinate the weekly produce distribution from local gardens.

I can commit to helping at least one distribution day per week,
and I'm available for planning meetings on Tuesday evenings.

I've been a community member for 3 months and have trust score
of 18. I've participated in two distributions as a volunteer and
would love to contribute more formally through the council.

Looking forward to working with you all!
```

Hi! I'm requesting to join the Tool Library Council. I'm a
carpenter by trade and have experience maintaining and repairing
tools. I've borrowed from the tool library several times and want
to help ensure tools stay in good condition.

I can commit to one maintenance session per month and help with
intake of new tool donations. I'm also happy to teach basic tool
safety workshops if there's interest.

My trust score is 22 and I've been active in the community for
5 months. Happy to answer any questions!

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. I hope to
rejoin when my schedule settles down!

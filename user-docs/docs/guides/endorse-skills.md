# How to Endorse Skills

This guide walks you through managing skills and endorsing others in your community.

## Before You Start

**What you'll need:**
- Community membership
- **Trust score ≥ 10** (default threshold for endorsing others' skills)
- Authentic experience with people whose skills you endorse

**Time required:**
- Adding your own skills: 2-3 minutes
- Endorsing others: 1 minute per endorsement

## Quick Start

Skills and endorsements build specific capability reputation in your community. While trust is general ("I trust this person"), skills are specific ("This person can do X well"). Endorsements from community members validate capabilities and help others find skilled service providers.

## Understanding Skills

### Skills vs. Trust vs. Value Recognition

**Three distinct systems:**

**Trust (General Reputation):**
- "I trust this person to participate responsibly"
- Gates access to features
- Relationship-based
- Community-wide

**Skills (Specific Capabilities):**
- "This person can do X competently"
- No feature gating
- Capability-based
- Helps others find service providers

**Value Recognition (Contribution Tracking):**
- "This person has contributed X to the community"
- Makes work visible
- Activity-based
- Appreciation and awareness

**All three matter:**
- High trust + many skill endorsements + high value recognition = highly validated member
- But each is independent and useful separately

### How Skills Work

**Simple tag system:**
- Skills are free-form text (e.g., "Carpentry", "JavaScript", "Gardening")
- Max 50 characters (couple of words)
- No predefined taxonomy—communities organically develop vocabulary
- Users add skills to their own profile

**Community-specific endorsements:**
- Each endorsement is per community
- "Carpentry" endorsements in Community A separate from Community B
- Builds local, contextual reputation
- Endorsement count shown is always for current community

**Self-endorsement allowed:**
- You can endorse your own skills
- Represents self-assessed competency
- Counts as 1 point

## Adding Your Own Skills

### Step-by-Step

**1. Navigate to User Preferences**
1. Click your profile icon/name
2. Go to **Preferences** or **Settings**
3. Find **Skills** section

**2. Add a Skill**
1. Click **Add Skill** button
2. Type the skill name
3. Press Enter or click Add
4. Repeat for more skills

**Examples of good skill names:**
- ✓ "Carpentry"
- ✓ "Web Design"
- ✓ "Organic Gardening"
- ✓ "First Aid"
- ✓ "Spanish Language"
- ✓ "Bicycle Repair"
- ✓ "Sourdough Baking"

**Not recommended:**
- ✗ "I am really good at lots of things" (too long, not specific)
- ✗ "Expert Master Carpenter" (boastful, use simple name)
- ✗ "Stuff" (too vague)

**3. Manage Your Skills**
- Remove skills by clicking X or Remove button
- Add more as you develop capabilities
- Keep list current with actual skills

!!! tip "Start with Core Skills"
    Add 3-5 skills you're genuinely competent in. You can always add more later.

_[Screenshot placeholder: User preferences skills section]_

### Choosing Skills to Add

**Add skills you:**
- ✓ Have real competency in
- ✓ Would offer as service
- ✓ Could teach others
- ✓ Have experience with
- ✓ Feel confident claiming

**Don't add:**
- ✗ Skills you're just beginning to learn
- ✗ Aspirational skills (what you want to learn)
- ✗ One-time lucky successes
- ✗ Skills you're not comfortable demonstrating

**Breadth vs. Depth:**
- Some people have many skills (generalists)
- Some people have few deep skills (specialists)
- Both are valuable
- Be honest about your profile

### Self-Endorsement

**After adding a skill:**
- You can endorse your own skill (if you meet trust threshold ≥10)
- This represents self-assessed competency
- Counts as 1 endorsement point
- Shows confidence in your ability

**When to self-endorse:**
- You're genuinely competent
- You'd be comfortable demonstrating this skill
- You want to signal availability to provide this service

**When not to self-endorse:**
- Still learning
- Not confident yet
- Would rather wait for others to validate

## Endorsing Others

### When to Endorse Someone's Skill

**Good reasons to endorse:**

**Direct experience:**
- They provided a service to you
- You observed them demonstrating the skill
- You've worked alongside them
- You received something they created

**Quality demonstrated:**
- Work was competent or excellent
- They showed skill and knowledge
- Results met or exceeded expectations
- You'd recommend them to others

**Examples:**
```
Endorse "Plumbing" because:
- They fixed your sink
- Work was high quality
- Explained what they were doing
- Problem solved, no leaks

Endorse "Guitar Teaching" because:
- They gave you lessons
- Patient and clear explanations
- You improved under their teaching
- Made learning enjoyable
```

### When NOT to Endorse

**Avoid endorsing if:**
- ✗ You haven't experienced their skill directly
- ✗ Only heard from others (secondhand)
- ✗ Work was mediocre or problematic
- ✗ They asked you to endorse
- ✗ Trading endorsements ("you endorse me, I'll endorse you")
- ✗ You're uncertain about their competency

!!! warning "Authentic Endorsements Only"
    Endorsements help others find skilled service providers. Hollow endorsements mislead the community and damage trust.

### Step-by-Step Endorsement

**Method 1: From Member Profile**

1. **Navigate to member's profile**
   - Click their name anywhere in the app
   - Or go to Members list and select them

2. **View their skills**
   - See list of skills they've added
   - Current endorsement counts
   - Your previous endorsements (if any)

3. **Endorse a skill**
   - Click **+** button next to the skill
   - Or click **Endorse** action
   - Confirmation appears

4. **Endorsement recorded**
   - Their endorsement count increases
   - You can't endorse same skill again (one per skill per person per community)
   - They may receive notification

**Method 2: After Wealth Fulfillment**

**Context-aware endorsement flow:**

1. **Receive item/service from someone**
2. **Mark request as fulfilled**
3. **System prompts: "Endorse skills?"**
4. **Shows relevant skills:**
   - If item has `relatedSkills` configured, those appear as suggestions
   - Example: Received handmade furniture → suggests "Carpentry", "Woodworking"
   - If no related skills match, shows all their skills

5. **One-click endorsement**
   - Click the skill(s) you want to endorse
   - Based on quality of what you received
   - Skip if you don't feel they demonstrated skill

**Example flow:**
```
You requested: Handmade bookshelf
Item has relatedSkills: ["Carpentry", "Woodworking", "Furniture Making"]
Sharer has skills: ["Carpentry", "Woodworking", "Piano"]

After confirming receipt, system shows:
"Endorse Alex's skills?"
[Carpentry] [Woodworking] (highlighted as related)
[Piano] (also shown but not highlighted)

You click [Carpentry] to endorse their carpentry skill.
```

- Enables smart endorsement suggestions

**Example item configurations:**
```
Item: "Handmade Furniture"
relatedSkills: ["Carpentry", "Woodworking", "Furniture Making"]

Item: "Website Development"
relatedSkills: ["Web Design", "JavaScript", "HTML/CSS"]

5. One click = appreciation and validation
6. Builds sharer's skill reputation

**This creates positive cycle:**
- Good work → endorsements
- Endorsements → more requests
- More requests → more practice
- More practice → better skills
- Better skills → more endorsements

## Common Scenarios

### Finding a Service Provider

**You need:**
1. Go to Members list
2. Look for members with relevant skill
3. Check endorsement counts
4. Higher counts = more community validation
5. Request their service with confidence

**Example:**
```
Need plumbing help →
Search members for "Plumbing" skill →
Find 3 members:
- Alice: Plumbing (2)
- Bob: Plumbing (15)
- Carol: Plumbing (8)

Bob has highest endorsement count, likely most validated.
Check Bob's profile, see his wealth shares for plumbing services.
Request from Bob with confidence in his competency.
```

### Building Your Skill Reputation

**Maria's journey:**
1. **Month 1:** Adds "Guitar" skill to profile
2. **Month 1:** Self-endorses (trust ≥10), count = 1
3. **Month 2:** Shares "Guitar Lessons" as wealth
4. **Month 2:** Teaches 3 students, all endorse her guitar skill
5. **Month 2:** Guitar endorsement count = 4
6. **Month 3-6:** Regular teaching, more endorsements
7. **Month 6:** Guitar endorsement count = 15
8. **Result:** Known as reliable guitar teacher in community

### Cross-Community Reputation

**Sam's experience:**
1. **Community A:** JavaScript skill endorsed 20 times
2. **Joins Community B:** JavaScript shows 0 endorsements
3. **Shares web development services in B**
4. **Completes projects, builds endorsements**
5. **6 months later:** JavaScript endorsed 12 times in Community B
6. **Each community has its own validation of Sam's skills**

**Why separate?**
- Different contexts and needs
- Local knowledge and experience
- Each community validates independently
- Prevents reputation transfer without local proof

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't endorse anyone's skills"

**Requirements to endorse:**
- Trust score ≥ 10 (default threshold)
- Active community membership

**Solutions:**
1. Check your trust score
2. Build trust through participation and sharing
3. Once you reach threshold, endorsement unlocks

### "Someone asked me to endorse their skill"

**How to respond:**

**If you've experienced their skill:**
- "I'd be happy to endorse after I've worked with you!"
- Complete the exchange first
- Endorse if quality warrants it

**If you haven't experienced their skill:**
- "I only endorse skills I've seen demonstrated directly. Let's work together first!"
- Decline politely
- Suggest ways they can demonstrate the skill

**If pressured:**
- "I prefer to endorse based on my own experience"
- Don't feel obligated
- Explain authentic endorsement principles

### "I endorsed someone by mistake"

**Solution:**
1. Go to their profile
2. Find the skill you endorsed
3. Click **-** or **Remove Endorsement**
4. Endorsement removed immediately

Mistakes happen—easy to fix.

### "Should I endorse mediocre work?"

**General rule:**
- Only endorse if you'd recommend them to others
- Mediocre work doesn't deserve endorsement
- You're helping others find good service providers
- Your endorsement carries weight

**If work was adequate but not endorsement-worthy:**
- Thank them
- Mark as fulfilled
- Skip endorsement
- No explanation needed

### "How many skills should I have?"

**No right answer:**
- Generalists might have 10-20 skills
- Specialists might have 2-5 skills
- Both are valuable
- Be honest about your profile

**Quality over quantity:**
- Better to have 3 well-endorsed skills
- Than 20 skills with few endorsements
- Focus on what you do well

## Advanced: Skills in Item Configuration

**For community admins/item managers:**

### Adding Related Skills to Items

**When configuring items:**
1. Edit item in item management
2. Find `relatedSkills` field
3. Add array of skill names
4. Save

**Example:**
```
Item: "Handmade Table"
relatedSkills: ["Carpentry", "Woodworking", "Furniture Making"]

Item: "Website Design Service"
relatedSkills: ["Web Design", "UI/UX Design", "HTML/CSS"]

Item: "Yoga Classes"
relatedSkills: ["Yoga", "Fitness Training", "Mindfulness"]
```

**Benefits:**
- Smart endorsement suggestions
- Contextual skill validation
- Natural endorsement flow
- Better skill-service connection

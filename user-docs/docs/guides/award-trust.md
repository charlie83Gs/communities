# How to Award Trust

This guide walks you through awarding and managing trust in your community.

## Before You Start

**What you'll need:**
- Community membership
- **Trust score ≥ 15** (default threshold for awarding trust)
- Genuine relationships with people you trust

**Time required:** 1-2 minutes per trust award

!!! warning "Can't Award Trust Yet?"
    If you don't meet the threshold, participate actively in the community. Share resources, engage authentically, and build relationships. Once you reach the trust threshold, you can begin awarding trust to others.

## Quick Start

Trust is the foundation of Communities's permission system. By awarding trust, you're saying "I trust this person to participate responsibly in our community." Trust awards are personal, autonomous decisions that collectively create community safety and enable decentralized governance.

## Understanding Trust

### What Trust Means

When you award trust to someone, you're saying:
- ✓ "I trust this person"
- ✓ "They've proven themselves through their actions"
- ✓ "I'd vouch for them in the community"
- ✓ "They're safe to have increased permissions"

**Trust is NOT:**
- ✗ Social obligation ("they trusted me so I have to trust them")
- ✗ Trading or bartering ("I'll trust you if you trust me")
- ✗ Friendship requirement (you can trust someone without being close friends)
- ✗ Permanent (you can remove trust if circumstances change)

### How Trust Works

**Simple scoring:**
```
Trust Score = Number of Community Members Who Trust You
```

If 17 members have awarded you trust, your score is 17.

**Unlocks permissions automatically:**
- Trust thresholds gate different community features
- Reach a threshold → gain permission immediately
- Lose trust → lose permission immediately
- No admin approval needed

**Common thresholds (community defaults):**
- 10: Request wealth/resources
- 15: Award trust to others, flag content
- 20: Create councils, manage items
- 25: Create councils (higher communities)
- 30: Moderate forum, review flags

!!! tip "Check Your Community's Thresholds"
    Each community can customize trust thresholds. Check Community Settings to see what unlocks at each level.

### When NOT to Award Trust

Avoid awarding trust in these situations:

**❌ Social Pressure**
- Someone asks you directly for trust
- "Everyone else is doing it"
- You feel obligated but uncertain

**❌ Trust Trading**
- "I'll trust you if you trust me"
- Quid pro quo arrangements
- Reciprocity expectations

**❌ Too Soon**
- Just met the person
- Haven't seen their behavior over time
- No direct interactions yet

## Managing Your Trust Awards

### Viewing Who You Trust

**See your trust awards:**
1. Go to your profile settings or trust management page
2. View list of people you've trusted
3. See when you awarded trust
4. Review trust status

### Removing Trust

**When to remove trust:**
- Behavior changed (violations, harmful actions)
- Commitments broken repeatedly
- Lost confidence in their judgment
- They left the community
- Relationship changed significantly

**How to remove trust:**
1. Go to the person's profile
2. Look for **Remove Trust** button (where Award Trust was)
3. Click it
4. Confirm the action

**What happens:**
- Their trust score decreases by 1 immediately
- They may lose permissions if score drops below threshold
- Action is recorded in trust history
- **No explanation required**—autonomous decision

!!! note "Removing Trust is Normal"
    Trust isn't permanent. It's appropriate to remove trust when circumstances change. This keeps the system accurate and meaningful.

### Trust History

All trust changes are tracked:
- Who awarded trust to you
- When it was awarded
- Who removed trust from you
- When it was removed
- Admin-granted trust (separate, auditable)

**Privacy:**
- What you can see depends on community settings
- Some communities show who trusts you
- Others keep it private
- Check your community's configuration

## Trust Award Patterns

### Building Trust as a Newcomer

**Week 1-2: Observe and Contribute**
- Share resources (doesn't require trust)
- Participate in discussions
- Introduce yourself
- Learn community norms

**Week 3-4: Active Engagement**
- Fulfill resource requests
- Follow through on commitments
- Help others
- Show consistency

**Month 2-3: First Trust Awards**
- Members you've worked with award trust
- Score reaches 5-10
- Start unlocking basic permissions
- Continue participating authentically

**Month 3-6: Established Member**
- Trust score reaches 15+
- Can award trust to others
- Most permissions unlocked
- Integrated into community

**Be patient:** Trust builds slowly through genuine relationships.

### Awarding Trust to Newcomers

**Approach:**
1. **Don't rush**—new members need time to demonstrate patterns
2. **Look for consistency**—one good interaction isn't enough
3. **Observe multiple contexts**—how do they behave across situations?
4. **Trust your instincts**—if uncertain, wait
5. **Start conservatively**—they can earn more trust over time

**Red flags:**
- Pushing for trust awards
- Only nice when they want something
- Inconsistent follow-through
- Demanding or entitled attitude
- Gaming behaviors

**Green flags:**
- Authentic participation
- Helpful without expectation
- Respectful of others
- Consistent over time
- Values-aligned behavior

### Mass Trust Awards (Avoid)

**Don't:**
- ✗ Award trust to everyone at once
- ✗ Trust people you haven't interacted with
- ✗ Trust based solely on others' recommendations
- ✗ Award trust to inflate numbers
- ✗ Create "trust circles" of mutual awards without substance

**Why it's harmful:**
- Undermines community safety
- Creates hollow trust without relationships
- Defeats the purpose of the system
- Makes thresholds meaningless

## Trust Anti-Patterns

### Trust Trading

**What it looks like:**
```
Alice to Bob: "Hey, I'll trust you if you trust me."
Bob: "Deal!"
[Both award trust without actual relationship]
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- No genuine relationship
- Inflates scores artificially
- Reduces community safety
- Creates meaningless trust networks

**What to do instead:**
- Build real relationships
- Earn trust through actions
- Award trust only when genuinely deserved
- Let trust build naturally

### Gaming the System

**What it looks like:**
- Creating alternate accounts to trust yourself
- Coordinating mass trust awards
- Pressuring others to award trust
- Trading favors for trust awards

**Why it's wrong:**
- Violates community integrity
- Undermines safety mechanisms
- Disrespects other members
- Usually discovered and addressed

**Consequences:**
- Community notices patterns
- Trust may be removed by many members
- Reputation damage
- Potential removal from community

### Trust Hoarding

**What it looks like:**
- Never removing trust once awarded
- Trusting people who've clearly changed
- Ignoring broken commitments
- Keeping outdated trust awards

**Why it's problematic:**
- Trust becomes inaccurate
- Misleads the community
- Enables harmful behavior
- Reduces system effectiveness

**What to do instead:**
- Review your trust awards periodically
- Remove trust when appropriate
- Keep trust current with relationships
- Act on changed circumstances

### Demanding Trust

**What it looks like:**
```
"Why don't people trust me?"
"How do I get more trust faster?"
"I've been here a month and only have 5 trust!"
"Can someone please trust me so I can [do thing]?"
```

**Why it's counterproductive:**
- Trust is earned, not demanded
- Pressure creates resentment
- Shows misunderstanding of trust purpose
- Often backfires

**What to do instead:**
- Focus on authentic participation
- Build genuine relationships
- Contribute without expectation
- Let trust follow naturally

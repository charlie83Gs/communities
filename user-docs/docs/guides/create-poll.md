# How to Create a Poll

This guide walks you through creating polls for community decision-making.

## Before You Start

**What you'll need:**
- Community membership
- **Trust score ≥ 15** (default threshold for creating polls)
- Clear question and options for your poll
- Understanding of what decision you're trying to make

**Time required:** 10-15 minutes to plan and create

## Quick Start

Polls enable democratic decision-making in your community. Use them for anything requiring collective input—from choosing event dates to making policy decisions. Good polls are clear, fair, and help the community move forward together.

## Planning Your Poll

Before creating the poll, think through:

### 1. Define Your Question

**What decision needs to be made?**
- Be specific and clear
- One decision per poll
- Frame neutrally (don't bias toward answer)
- Make it answerable by the options provided

**Good questions:**
- ✓ "When should we hold the community harvest festival?"
- ✓ "Should we allocate pool funds to the garden project?"
- ✓ "Which day works best for weekly meetings?"

**Poor questions:**
- ✗ "What do you think?" (too vague)
- ✗ "Should we do the obviously good thing or the bad thing?" (biased)
- ✗ "Plans for the festival?" (not answerable by simple options)

### 2. Determine Options

**Provide clear choices:**
- 2-6 options typically work best
- Too many options = decision paralysis
- Too few options = false dichotomy
- Include "Other" or "None of the above" if appropriate

**Example - Event Date Poll:**
```
Question: "When should we hold the harvest festival?"

Options:
- Saturday, October 15 (afternoon)
- Sunday, October 16 (afternoon)
- Saturday, October 22 (afternoon)
- Sunday, October 23 (afternoon)
```

**Example - Policy Decision:**
```
Question: "Should we increase the trust threshold for pool creation?"

Options:
- Yes, increase to 25 (from current 20)
- No, keep at 20
- Other threshold (comment below)
```

### 3. Choose Poll Type

**Single Choice:**
- Voters pick one option only
- Use for: Final decisions, choosing between alternatives
- Example: "Which day for the event?"

**Multiple Choice:**
- Voters can select multiple options
- Use for: Gathering preferences, non-exclusive choices
- Example: "Which workshops interest you?" (can like multiple)

### 4. Set Duration

**How long should voting stay open?**

**Short polls (1-3 days):**
- Time-sensitive decisions
- High engagement communities
- Simple yes/no questions
- Risk: Not everyone sees it

**Medium polls (1-2 weeks):**
- Standard community decisions
- Allows time for discussion
- Most members can participate
- Good default

**Long polls (2-4 weeks):**
- Major policy changes
- Low-engagement communities
- Complex issues needing discussion
- Risk: People forget about it

!!! tip "Match Duration to Importance"
    Bigger decisions deserve longer voting periods. Give people time to think and discuss.

### 5. Plan Promotion

**How will people know about the poll?**
- Post in community forum
- Mention in meetings
- Message key stakeholders
- Pin announcement if admin
- Follow up reminder before closing

## Step-by-Step Creation

### 1. Navigate to Polls

1. Go to your community page
2. Find the **Polls** or **Voting** section
3. Click **Create Poll** button

_[Screenshot placeholder: Polls page with create button]_

### 2. Write Your Question

**Poll Question (Required):**
- Clear, specific, neutral
- Asks what you want to know
- Complete sentence with question mark
- 10-200 characters recommended

**Example questions:**
```
"Should we approve the proposed budget for the community garden?"

"Which monthly meeting time works best for you?"

"Do you support increasing the minimum trust threshold for council creation?"
```

### 3. Add Poll Options

**For each option:**
1. Click **Add Option**
2. Enter option text (clear and concise)
3. Repeat for all choices
4. Minimum 2 options required
5. Maximum 10 options allowed (typically 2-6 is best)

**Option writing tips:**
- ✓ Keep options parallel in structure
- ✓ Make them mutually exclusive (for single choice polls)
- ✓ Use clear, simple language
- ✓ Avoid loaded or biased wording

**Example - Good Options:**
```
Option 1: "Approve budget as proposed ($500)"
Option 2: "Approve reduced budget ($300)"
Option 3: "Reject budget and revisit proposal"
```

**Example - Poor Options:**
```
Option 1: "Yes, obviously we should approve this great budget"
Option 2: "No, because reasons"
Option 3: "Maybe?"
```

### 4. Configure Poll Settings

**Poll Type:**
- **Single Choice**: One vote per person
- **Multiple Choice**: Can select multiple options

**Voting Duration:**
- Set end date/time
- Or set number of days (e.g., "7 days from now")
- Consider time zones in multi-timezone communities

**Visibility:**
- **Public votes**: Everyone sees who voted for what
- **Anonymous votes**: Only see vote counts, not who voted
- Choose based on topic sensitivity

**Vote Changes:**
- **Allow changes**: Voters can change their vote before poll closes
- **Lock votes**: First vote is final
- Most polls allow changes

### 5. Add Context (Optional but Recommended)

**Description/Background:**
- Explain the decision
- Provide necessary context
- Link to related discussions
- Include relevant information

**Example:**
```
The garden council is requesting $500 to expand the community
garden plots. This would add 6 new raised beds and irrigation.
Funds would come from the community pool. See full proposal:
[link to forum thread]

Voting closes Friday, October 14 at 5pm.

- Reduces confusion
- Shows you've thought it through
- Respects voters' time

3. Verify options make sense
4. Confirm duration
5. Click **Create Poll** or **Publish**

## Troubleshooting

### "Not enough people are voting"

**Solutions:**
1. Promote more actively (forum post, announcements)
2. Extend voting period
3. Explain why the decision matters
4. Ask people directly (respectfully)
5. Consider if timing is bad
6. Check if question is confusing

### "Results are too close to decide"

**Options:**
1. Extend discussion period
2. Create new poll with refined options
3. Hybrid approach combining top options
4. Seek consensus through forum discussion
5. Table decision until more clarity

### "People are arguing about the question"

**Response:**
1. Clarify in comments
2. Consider closing and recreating with better question
3. Acknowledge the confusion
4. Learn for next time
5. Facilitate discussion separately

### "I want to edit the poll after publishing"

**Usually can't edit:**
- Question or options (would invalidate existing votes)
- Poll type (single vs. multiple choice)

**Can often edit:**
- Description/context
- End date (extend if needed)

**If you need major changes:**
1. Close current poll
2. Create new poll with corrections
3. Explain why in announcement

## Advanced: Weighted or Ranked Voting

Some communities may support:

**Ranked Choice:**
- Voters rank options in preference order
- Avoids vote splitting
- More complex to understand

**Weighted by Trust:**
- Votes weighted by trust score
- Controversial approach
- May exclude newcomers

**Quadratic Voting:**
- Can allocate multiple votes
- But cost increases quadratically
- Allows showing strength of preference

!!! note "Check Your Community"
    Advanced voting methods may not be available in all communities. Start with simple single-choice polls.

# How to Request Resources

This guide walks you through requesting wealth from your community step-by-step.

## Before You Start

**What you'll need:**
- Community membership
- **Trust score ≥ 10** (community default—requesting requires proven trustworthiness)
- Clear understanding of what you need

**Time required:** 5-10 minutes per request

!!! warning "Can't Request Yet?"
    If you don't meet the trust threshold, start by sharing resources and participating in the community. Trust builds naturally through contribution and engagement.

## Quick Start

Requesting is the receiving side of Communities's gift economy. You browse what community members are sharing and request what you genuinely need—no payment required. The key is thoughtful, respectful requesting that builds relationships.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Browse Available Wealth

1. Navigate to your community page
2. Click the **Wealth** tab
3. Browse the list of shared resources

**Filtering options:**
- **Type:** Objects only, Services only, or All
- **Status:** Available, Pending, Fulfilled
- **Search:** Type keywords to find specific items

### 4. Check Your Permissions

Before requesting, verify:

**Community-Wide Requirements:**
- ✓ Trust score ≥ community minimum (usually 10)
- ✓ Units still available
- ✓ You're an active community member

**Item-Specific Requirements:**
- Some sharers set higher trust for valuable items
- Example: "Car sharing requires 50 trust"
- You'll see this clearly in the item details

**Request Limits:**
- Note the "max units per person" if set
- You can't request more than this limit
- Leave room for others in the community

!!! tip "Respect Limits"
    Max units per person exists to distribute resources fairly. Don't try to work around limits with multiple requests.

### 5. Write a Thoughtful Request

Click **Request** and fill in the form:

#### Units Requested (Required)
- How many units you need
- Must not exceed max units per person
- Must not exceed available units
- Be honest—only request what you'll actually use

#### Message to Sharer (Optional but Strongly Recommended)
Explain your request clearly and respectfully:

**Include:**
- Why you need this item/service
- When/where you'd like to coordinate
- Any relevant context about your situation
- Appreciation for their generosity

**Good request messages:**

**Example 1 - Object:**
```
Hi! I'm renovating my spare room into a home office and could
really use your tools this weekend. I've done some carpentry before
so I'm comfortable using them safely. I can pick up Saturday morning
and return them Sunday evening in the same condition. Thank you so
much for sharing these with the community!
```

**Example 2 - Service:**
```
Hello! My daughter is struggling with algebra and your tutoring
would be incredibly helpful. We're available Tuesday or Thursday
evenings after 5pm. She's motivated to learn but needs some
one-on-one help to build confidence. We really appreciate you
offering your teaching skills to the community.
```

**Example 3 - Food:**
```
Hi! We're hosting a community potluck dinner this Friday and your
fresh tomatoes would be perfect for our salad. I can pick them up
Thursday evening or Friday morning—whatever works best for you.
Thanks for growing and sharing!
```

**Poor request messages (avoid):**
```
"I want this."
```
```
"Can I have 5?"
```
```
[No message at all]
```

!!! tip "Messages Matter"
    A thoughtful message shows respect for the sharer's generosity and helps them feel good about accepting your request. It builds relationship.

### Writing Request Messages

**DO:**

### Responding to Sharer Questions

**Be helpful:**

```
Sharer: "When do you need the drill by?"
You: "I'm renovating this weekend, so ideally Saturday morning.
But if that doesn't work, I could pick it up Friday evening or
even push to next weekend if you need it this week."

Sharer: "Do you have experience with power tools?"
You: "Yes, I've used drills for basic home repairs. I'll be
installing shelves, so mostly straightforward drilling. I'll
take good care of it and return it clean."
```

### Following Up

**If no response after a few days:**
1. Send a polite follow-up message
2. Don't be pushy—sharers aren't obligated to respond
3. Consider looking for alternative sources
4. Be patient—people have different response times

**Example follow-up:**
```
Hi! Just wanted to follow up on my request from last week. I
totally understand if you've been busy or decided to share with
someone else. Let me know if you need any more info from me.
Thanks!
```

## Common Scenarios

### Requesting Tools

**Best approach:**
1. Mention your project clearly
2. Demonstrate you know how to use the tool safely
3. Propose specific pickup/return dates
4. Commit to returning in good condition
5. Actually return on time, cleaned

**Example:**
```
I'm building raised garden beds this weekend and your circular
saw would be perfect. I've used saws before for furniture projects
so I'm comfortable with safe operation. I can pick up Friday
evening and return Sunday evening, cleaned and in same condition.
Really appreciate you sharing your tools!
```

### Requesting Services

**Best approach:**
1. Explain your specific need
2. Show respect for their time and expertise
3. Propose scheduling options (show flexibility)
4. Express genuine appreciation
5. Be a good learner/recipient

**Example:**
```
My son is struggling with geometry and getting frustrated. Your
math tutoring would make a huge difference. We're available
Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday evenings. He's motivated but
needs patient, clear explanations. Thank you for offering your
teaching skills to help community members!
```

### Requesting Food

**Best approach:**
1. Express genuine appreciation for their growing/cooking
2. Mention your intended use (if relevant)
3. Coordinate pickup promptly (food is perishable)
4. Bring appropriate containers
5. Share how it turned out ("The soup was amazing!")

**Example:**
```
Your homegrown tomatoes look incredible! I'm making pasta sauce
for a family dinner this weekend. I can pick up tomorrow afternoon
or Friday morning—whatever works for you. I'll bring a container
if you prefer. Thank you for sharing your garden harvest!
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Why can't I request items?"

**Reason 1: Trust too low**
- Check your trust score
- Community minimum is usually 10
- Build trust by sharing and participating

**What to do:**
1. Share your own resources (no trust required to give)
2. Participate in community discussions
3. Engage authentically with members
4. Be patient—trust builds over time

**Reason 2: No units available**
- All units already requested by others
- Item might be fulfilled or expired

**What to do:**
1. Watch for when sharer adds more units
2. Ask in forum if anyone else is sharing
3. Share your need (publish a need for the item)
4. Consider sharing similar items yourself first

### "My requests keep getting rejected"

**Possible reasons:**
- Messages are too brief or generic
- Requesting too much too often
- Low trust score (even if above minimum)
- Timing doesn't work for sharers
- Other requesters have priority

**Improve your chances:**
1. Write thoughtful, specific messages
2. Request only what you genuinely need
3. Build trust through sharing and participation
4. Be flexible about timing
5. Build relationships in the community first
6. Start with smaller requests

### "Sharer isn't responding to my request"

**Remember:**
- Sharers aren't obligated to respond immediately
- They might be busy or away
- They might be considering multiple requests
- They have full autonomy to reject

**What to do:**
1. Wait at least 3-5 days before following up
2. Send one polite follow-up message
3. Look for alternative sources
4. Don't pressure or demand response
5. Stay respectful and positive

### "I received damaged item"

**Steps:**
1. Message the sharer immediately
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Share photos if relevant
4. Ask if they knew about the damage
5. Determine if it's usable despite damage

**Most sharers will:**
- Apologize and explain
- Offer alternative item
- Accept the item back
- Be honest about what they knew

**If sharer is unresponsive or dishonest:**
- Mark request as failed (not fulfilled)
- Consider removing trust
- Create dispute if serious (if enabled in community)
- Move on—don't dwell

### "I can't fulfill the return date"

**Communicate early:**
1. Message the sharer as soon as you know
2. Explain the situation honestly
3. Propose new return date
4. Apologize for the inconvenience
5. Follow through on the new commitment

**Example:**
```
Hi, I'm so sorry but my project is taking longer than expected.
I still need the saw for a few more days. Could I return it on
Wednesday instead of Sunday? I really apologize for the delay
and I'm taking great care of it. Let me know if Wednesday works
or if you need it back sooner.
```

# Administrator Documentation

Welcome to the community administrator documentation. These guides will help you create, configure, and manage your community effectively.

## Overview

As a community administrator, you're responsible for:
- Creating and bootstrapping your community
- Configuring settings and trust thresholds
- Managing members and roles
- Monitoring community health
- Moderating discussions
- Maintaining a healthy, thriving community

This isn't traditional platform administration. You're not a ruler—you're a steward helping a community self-organize and thrive.

## Admin Philosophy

### You're a Steward, Not a Ruler

**Traditional platform admin**:
- Controls access through permissions
- Enforces rules top-down
- Makes unilateral decisions
- Maintains power indefinitely

**Gift economy admin**:
- **Bootstraps trust system** then steps back
- **Facilitates** peer validation
- **Supports** democratic access
- **Works towards** community self-governance

**Goal**: Your active management becomes less necessary over time.

### Trust-Based Access

Unlike traditional systems where admins grant permissions, this platform uses peer-validated access:

**How it works**:
1. Members earn trust from other members
2. Trust score reflects community confidence
3. Higher trust = more permissions
4. Admins bootstrap, community sustains

**Your role**:
- Grant initial admin trust to seed members
- Set appropriate trust thresholds
- Monitor trust distribution
- Reduce admin trust as peer trust grows

**Why**: Creates democratic, self-sustaining access rather than admin-controlled hierarchy.

### Two Paths to Access

Members can gain access through:

**1. Trust-based**: Automatically when trust score reaches threshold (democratic)
**2. Role-based**: Explicitly granted by admin (immediate)

**Both paths** lead to same permissions.

**When to use each**:
- **Trust**: Default, most members, democratic access
- **Roles**: Specific situations, immediate needs, special competencies

### Community Self-Governance

**The vision**:
- Community sets its own norms
- Members moderate through trust
- Conflicts resolved through dialogue
- Decisions made collectively
- Admin intervention becomes rare

**Your journey**:
- **Year 1**: Active bootstrapping, frequent involvement
- **Year 2**: Transitioning to peer systems, less intervention
- **Year 3+**: Mostly observing, occasional course corrections

## Best Practices Summary

2. **Use defaults**: They're tested and balanced
3. **Bootstrap thoughtfully**: Grant admin trust to seed community
4. **Review regularly**: Settings should evolve with community
5. **Communicate changes**: Members deserve transparency

### Member Management

1. **Welcome warmly**: First impressions shape integration
2. **Bootstrap trust**: Seed members need access to participate
3. **Trust peer validation**: Let members validate each other
4. **Use roles sparingly**: Rely on trust-based access when possible
5. **Focus on restoration**: Repair relationships, don't just punish

## The Admin Journey

### Phase 1: Bootstrapping (0-6 months)

**Your role**: Very active
- Creating and configuring community
- Inviting and welcoming members
- Granting admin trust liberally
- Setting up systems and norms
- Teaching how everything works

**Goal**: Get community running

### Phase 2: Transition (6-18 months)

**Your role**: Moderately active
- Reducing admin trust as peer trust grows
- Encouraging peer validation
- Supporting emerging leaders
- Stepping back from daily decisions
- Intervening on significant issues only

**Goal**: Build self-sustaining systems

### Phase 3: Stewardship (18+ months)

**Your role**: Observant but hands-off
- Monitoring health metrics
- Addressing systemic issues
- Supporting community decisions
- Intervening rarely
- Celebrating community achievements

**Goal**: Community self-governance

## Final Thoughts

Being a community administrator in a gift economy is different from traditional platform administration. You're not building a kingdom—you're cultivating a garden.

**Your success is measured by**:
- How well members trust each other (not how much they trust you)
- How self-regulating the community becomes (not how much control you maintain)
- How rarely intervention is needed (not how much you do)
- How resilient the community is without you (not how essential you are)

The best admins work themselves out of necessity. Build systems that don't need you. Foster culture that sustains itself. Create space for community to self-organize.

Then step back and watch it flourish.

# Community Moderation Guide

This guide covers forum moderation, handling flagged content, conflict resolution, and maintaining community safety.

## Overview

Moderation in this system is different from traditional platforms:
- **Trust-based**: Community members moderate through trust decisions
- **Transparent**: All actions are logged and visible
- **Restorative**: Focus on healing, not punishment
- **Distributed**: Multiple moderators share responsibility

## Understanding Your Role

### As an Admin

You have moderation capabilities by default:
- Can moderate all content
- Can assign Forum Manager roles
- Can review all moderation logs
- Set moderation policies

**Your job**: Support community health, not police content

### As a Forum Manager

If you've been assigned the Forum Manager role:
- Can moderate forum content
- Can manage categories
- Can review flagged content
- Actions are logged

**Your job**: Facilitate healthy discussion, address problems promptly

### Trust-Based Moderation

Members with high trust (default: 30+) can:
- Review flagged content
- Make moderation recommendations
- Participate in community moderation

**Their job**: Bring community perspective to moderation

## Forum Moderation Capabilities

### What Forum Managers Can Do

#### Content Management

**Create/Edit/Delete Categories**:
- Organize forum into topic areas
- Rename or reorganize as needed
- Delete unused categories (with care)

**Pin/Unpin Threads**:
- Pin important threads to top of category
- Pin to homepage for community-wide visibility
- Unpin when no longer needed

**Lock/Unlock Threads**:
- Lock thread to prevent new posts (keeps visible)
- Use when: Discussion is complete, becoming unproductive, needs cooling off
- Unlock when appropriate to resume discussion

**Move Threads**:
- Move to appropriate category
- Use when: Thread posted in wrong place, topic changed

**Edit/Delete Posts**:
- Edit posts to remove problematic content (last resort)
- Delete posts that violate guidelines
- **All edits and deletions are logged with reason**

**Edit/Delete Threads**:
- Edit thread title or content
- Delete entire thread if necessary
- Use sparingly—deletion removes entire conversation

#### Moderation Queue

**Review Flagged Content**:
- See posts/threads flagged by members
- Review flags and decide action
- Approve (remove flags) or act (remove/edit content)

**Take Action on Reports**:
- Warn user
- Remove content
- Lock thread
- Note in moderation log

### What Regular Admins Can Do

All of the above, plus:
- Assign/remove Forum Manager role
- View all moderation logs
- Override moderation decisions
- Set moderation policies

## The Flagging System

### How Flagging Works

**Who can flag**:
- Members with sufficient trust (default: 15+)
- Cannot flag their own content

**Flag types**:
- **Spam**: Irrelevant advertising or repetitive content
- **Off-topic**: Doesn't belong in this thread/category
- **Harassment**: Personal attacks or bullying
- **Misinformation**: Deliberately false or misleading
- **Other**: Specify custom reason

**Flag threshold**:
- Content auto-hidden after X flags (default: 5)
- Hidden content goes to moderation queue
- Not deleted—just hidden pending review

### Reviewing Flagged Content

**Access the queue**:
1. Navigate to Forum
2. Click "Moderation" tab (visible to forum managers)
3. See list of flagged content

**For each flagged item, see**:
- The content itself
- Who flagged it and why
- How many flags total
- Context (thread, category)
- User who posted it

**Actions available**:
- **Approve**: Remove flags, content is fine
- **Edit**: Modify content to remove problematic part
- **Remove**: Delete the content
- **Warn**: Keep content but warn user
- **Lock**: Lock the thread
- **Escalate**: Bring to admin team

**Record your decision**:
- Always add reason for action
- Logged in moderation history
- Visible to other moderators and admins

### Best Practices for Flagging Review

**Review promptly**:
- Check queue daily if possible
- Flagged content causes stress—resolve quickly
- Hidden content disrupts discussion

**Seek context**:
- Read the full thread
- Check user's history
- Understand what led to this
- Consider if genuinely problematic

**Be consistent**:
- Apply same standards across all content
- Document guidelines for gray areas
- Consult other moderators when unsure

**Communicate decisions**:
- Explain why content was removed/approved
- Private message to user when appropriate
- Public note if it affects community
- Learn and adjust

## Handling Different Situations

### Spam or Advertising

**Clear spam** (irrelevant ads, bots):
- **Action**: Delete immediately
- **Warn**: No (likely bot)
- **Log**: "Spam - commercial advertising"

**Borderline promotion** (member sharing their project):
- **Consider**: Is it relevant to community? Did they contribute elsewhere?
- **Action**: If relevant and they're active member, approve
- **Action**: If purely promotional, remove with explanation
- **Communicate**: Explain promotion guidelines

### Off-Topic Content

**Completely off-topic**:
- **Action**: Move to appropriate category or "Off-Topic" category
- **Warn**: No, just redirect
- **Note**: "Moved to appropriate category"

**Thread drift** (started on-topic, wandered):
- **Action**: Usually fine—natural conversation
- **Consider**: Only act if derailment is problematic
- **Option**: Split into new thread if valuable tangent

### Personal Conflicts

**Heated but respectful disagreement**:
- **Action**: None—healthy debate is good
- **Monitor**: Watch to ensure it stays respectful
- **Intervene**: Only if crosses into personal attacks

**Arguments getting personal**:
- **Action**: Post reminder about respectful communication
- **Lock**: If needed to cool down (temporary)
- **Message**: Private message to parties involved
- **Escalate**: To conflict resolution if continues

**Clear harassment or bullying**:
- **Action**: Remove harassing content immediately
- **Warn**: Direct warning to harasser
- **Protect**: Ensure victim feels safe
- **Escalate**: May involve removal from community

### Misinformation

**Honest mistakes**:
- **Action**: Reply with correction or allow community to correct
- **No deletion**: Let correction stand as learning
- **Context**: Explanation matters

**Deliberately misleading**:
- **Action**: Add moderator note with correction
- **Consider**: Removal if harmful
- **Warn**: Explain misinformation policy
- **Pattern**: If repeated, escalate

**Dangerous misinformation** (health, safety):
- **Action**: Remove immediately
- **Replace**: Post with accurate information
- **Warn**: Direct warning about harm
- **Escalate**: May warrant removal from community

### Duplicate Posts

**Accidental duplicates**:
- **Action**: Delete duplicate, keep original
- **No warning**: Clearly unintentional
- **Note**: "Duplicate removed"

**Spam duplicates**:
- **Action**: Delete all but one
- **Warn**: If intentional
- **Pattern**: Multiple duplicates = spam behavior

## Moderation Actions Explained

### Warning

**What it is**: Official notice to member about guideline violation

**When to use**:
- First offense (usually)
- Borderline behavior
- When education might help

**How it works**:
1. Send private message explaining issue
2. Reference specific guidelines
3. Explain what to do differently
4. Log warning in moderation history

**Template**:
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out about [specific post/behavior].

Our community guidelines ask that [relevant guideline].

Your [post/behavior] [explain the issue].

Going forward, please [specific request].

Let me know if you have questions about this.

Thanks,
[Your Name], Forum Manager
```

### Post/Thread Removal

**What it is**: Deleting content from the forum

**When to use**:
- Clear guideline violations
- Spam or harassment
- After warning went unheeded
- Dangerous content

**How it works**:
1. Delete the content
2. **Required**: Add removal reason to log
3. Notify user (unless spam)
4. Consider warning alongside removal

**What happens**:
- Content is deleted
- Original poster is notified
- Logged in moderation history
- Other moderators can see the action

### Thread Lock

**What it is**: Prevent new posts while keeping thread visible

**When to use**:
- Discussion needs to cool down
- Question answered, further replies unhelpful
- Thread becoming unproductive
- Temporary measure before resolution

**How it works**:
1. Click "Lock Thread"
2. Add reason for lock
3. Optionally post explanation in thread
4. Can unlock later

**Best practice**: Post final message explaining lock and timeline

**Example**:
```
"Locking this thread temporarily while we sort out some issues.
Will reopen in 48 hours. Please reach out if you want to discuss."
```

### Content Edit

**What it is**: Modifying member's post content

**When to use**: **Very rarely**
- Prefer removal over editing
- Only edit to remove small problematic section from otherwise good post
- Clear, obvious issue (profanity, personal info)

**How it works**:
1. Edit the content
2. Add [Edited by moderator: reason] notation
3. Log edit with full explanation
4. Notify original poster

**Warning**: Editing others' words is serious. Use very sparingly.

### Category Management

**What it is**: Creating, editing, or deleting forum categories

**When to use**:
- Community needs better organization
- Clear topic clusters emerging
- Unused categories cluttering forum

**How it works**:
1. Navigate to Categories management
2. Create/Edit/Delete as needed
3. Move existing threads if reorganizing
4. Announce changes to community

**Best practice**: Consult community before major reorganization

## Moderation Principles

### Transparency

**All moderation is visible**:
- Moderation log shows all actions
- Reasons are documented
- Other moderators can review
- Community can see patterns

**Why**: Accountability prevents abuse, builds trust

**Practice**:
- Always add clear reason
- Explain decisions when asked
- Document policies
- Admit mistakes

### Consistency

**Apply rules fairly**:
- Same violation = same response
- Don't favor friends or target critics
- Document precedents
- Be predictable

**Why**: Fairness is foundational to trust

**Practice**:
- Document common situations
- Consult other moderators
- Review your own patterns
- Adjust policies if inconsistent

### Restoration Over Punishment

**Focus on repair**:
- What would make this right?
- How can we heal?
- What does the person need?
- How do we prevent recurrence?

**Why**: Punishment creates resentment; restoration builds community

**Practice**:
- Talk to people, not just about them
- Seek understanding before action
- Offer second chances
- Celebrate growth

### Minimal Intervention

**Let community self-regulate**:
- Trust community to handle most issues
- Only intervene when necessary
- Allow disagreement and debate
- Step in for serious issues only

**Why**: Over-moderation kills authentic community

**Practice**:
- Watch before acting
- Let community correct first
- Use lightest touch needed
- Build capacity for self-moderation

### Cultural Coherence

**Moderation reflects values**:
- What kind of culture do we want?
- What behaviors support that?
- What threatens it?
- How do we respond?

**Why**: Moderation is culture enforcement

**Practice**:
- Articulate community values
- Connect actions to values
- Explain cultural reasoning
- Evolve with community

## Working with Other Moderators

### Multiple Moderators

**Benefits**:
- Distribute workload
- Multiple perspectives
- Accountability
- Coverage

**Coordination**:
- Regular moderator meetings
- Shared moderation log review
- Discuss difficult cases
- Align on policies

### Decision-Making

**Solo decisions** (routine):
- Clear spam
- Obvious violations
- Routine categorization
- Simple flags

**Consult others** (complex):
- Gray areas
- Significant conflicts
- Community impact
- Precedent-setting

**Group decisions** (major):
- Policy changes
- Member removal
- Category reorganization
- Cultural questions

### Moderator Disagreements

**When you disagree with another moderator's action**:
1. **Don't undo immediately**: Talk first
2. **Understand reasoning**: Ask why they decided that
3. **Share concerns**: Explain your perspective
4. **Seek alignment**: Can you agree on approach?
5. **Escalate if needed**: Bring to full admin team

**When another moderator questions you**:
1. **Explain reasoning**: Share your thinking
2. **Stay open**: They may have a point
3. **Reconsider if appropriate**: Willing to adjust
4. **Stand firm if certain**: But document why
5. **Bring to team**: If can't resolve

## Moderation Log

### What's Logged

Every moderation action creates a record:
- **Action taken**: Delete, edit, lock, warn, etc.
- **Moderator**: Who took the action
- **Target**: Content or member affected

- **Original content**: What was removed/edited

### Reviewing the Log

- Member patterns (repeat issues?)
- Community trends (what issues are common?)

**Regular review**:
- Weekly: Check your own recent actions
- Monthly: Review all moderation patterns

### Publishing Guidelines

**Make them accessible**:
- Pin in forum
- Link in community description
- Reference in moderation actions
- Update as needed

**Get community input**:
- Draft collaboratively
- Gather feedback
- Revise based on input
- Build buy-in

## Conflict Resolution

### When Moderation Isn't Enough

**Some issues require more than moderation**:
- Deep interpersonal conflicts
- Community divisions
- Repeated boundary violations
- Patterns of harm

**Conflict resolution process**:
1. **Acknowledge**: Recognize the conflict exists
2. **Understand**: Talk to all parties separately
3. **Facilitate**: Bring parties together (if safe)
4. **Resolve**: Find path forward
5. **Follow up**: Ensure resolution holds

### Using the Dispute System

If your community has formal dispute resolution enabled:

**When to create a dispute**:
- Conflict persists despite moderation
- Mediation needed
- Formal documentation required
- Community impact significant

**How it works**:
1. Create dispute in Disputes section
2. Assign mediators (neutral parties)
3. Gather accounts from all parties
4. Facilitate resolution process
5. Document outcome
6. Close dispute

**Benefits**:
- Structured process
- Neutral facilitation
- Documented resolution
- Learning for community

## Community Safety

### Recognizing Serious Issues

**Immediate safety concerns**:
- Threats of violence
- Harassment campaigns
- Doxxing or privacy violations
- Illegal activity

**Action**:
1. Remove content immediately
2. Alert all admins
3. Consider temporary suspension
4. Document thoroughly
5. Escalate externally if needed (legal, platform)

### Protecting Vulnerable Members

**When someone is being targeted**:
- Remove harassing content quickly
- Check in with targeted person
- Ensure they feel safe
- Provide support options
- Address harasser firmly

**Ongoing protection**:
- Monitor for continued issues
- Consider temporary restrictions on harasser
- Empower target to block/report
- Create accountability

### When to Remove Members

**Removal is serious** - last resort after other attempts

**Appropriate reasons**:
- Repeated severe violations after warnings
- Harassment that continues despite intervention
- Behavior that makes community unsafe
- Extractive patterns after extensive conversation

**Process**:
1. Document pattern of issues
2. Consult admin team
3. Attempt resolution (if safe)
4. Make decision together
5. Communicate clearly
6. Remove if necessary

**See**: [Managing Members guide](./managing-members.md) for full removal process

## Self-Care for Moderators

## Summary

Effective moderation:

1. **Supports community**: Health, not control
2. **Stays transparent**: All actions visible
3. **Remains consistent**: Fair for all
4. **Focuses on restoration**: Healing, not punishment
5. **Intervenes minimally**: Trust community first
6. **Protects safety**: Act on serious issues
7. **Cares for moderators**: Your wellbeing matters

Remember: You're not a cop or a judge. You're a steward helping the community maintain healthy culture. The best moderation is the kind nobody notices because the community is self-regulating, respectful, and handling minor issues themselves.

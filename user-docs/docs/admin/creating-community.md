# Creating and Bootstrapping Your Community

This guide walks you through creating a new community and getting it ready for members.

## Overview

Creating a community is just the beginning. The real work is setting it up so members can thrive together. This guide covers:

- Creating the community
- Making initial configuration decisions
- Bootstrapping the trust system
- Inviting your first members
- Getting your community active

## Step 1: Create Your Community

### Basic Information

1. Navigate to the Communities page
2. Click "Create Community"
3. Provide:
   - **Community Name**: Choose something meaningful and clear
   - **Description**: Explain your community's purpose and values
   - **Location** (optional): Where your community operates

### What Happens When You Create

When you create a community, you automatically become its first administrator. You'll have full access to:

- Community settings
- Member management
- Trust bootstrapping
- Feature configuration

## Step 2: Initial Configuration Decisions

Before inviting members, think through these key decisions:

### Trust System Philosophy

**Question: How will trust work in your community?**

Two approaches:
1. **Trust-based access**: Members earn permissions through peer trust (democratic)
2. **Role-based access**: Admins assign roles explicitly (controlled)
3. **Hybrid**: Use both (recommended for most communities)

**Recommendation**: Start with moderate trust thresholds and adjust based on experience.

### Access Philosophy

**Question: How open or restricted should features be?**

Options:
- **Open**: Low trust thresholds, most members can participate quickly
- **Restricted**: Higher thresholds, slower integration, more protection
- **Progressive**: Start restricted, relax over time as community stabilizes

**Recommendation**: Start slightly restricted. It's easier to relax restrictions than impose them later.

### Feature Selection

**Question: Which features does your community need?**

Consider enabling/disabling:
- **Pools**: For shared resource management (good for most communities)
- **Councils**: For specialized working groups (useful if you have sub-organizations)
- **Forum**: For discussions (nearly always useful)
- **Needs System**: For resource planning (good for resource-focused communities)
- **Value Recognition**: For contribution tracking (optional, can add later)

**Recommendation**: Start with basic features (forum, wealth sharing) and add others as needs emerge.

## Step 3: Configure Initial Settings

Navigate to Community Settings and configure:

### General Settings

Set or review:
- Community name and description
- Any community-wide announcements
- Contact information for admins

### Trust Thresholds (See Trust Thresholds Guide)

Set initial thresholds for:
- Awarding trust to others (default: 15)
- Sharing wealth (default: 10)
- Creating threads in forum (default: 10)
- Creating pools (default: 20)
- Creating councils (default: 25)

**Recommendation**: Use defaults initially, adjust after observing member behavior.

### Feature Flags

Enable the features your community will use:
- Pools (recommended: enabled)
- Forum (recommended: enabled)
- Councils (optional, can enable later)
- Health Analytics (recommended: enabled for admins)
- Value Recognition (optional)

## Step 4: Bootstrap the Trust System

This is the most important step for new communities.

### The Trust Bootstrapping Problem

New communities face a paradox:
- Members need trust to participate
- Trust comes from other members
- But there are no trusted members yet!

**Solution**: Admins bootstrap trust by granting initial trust to seed members.

### How to Bootstrap Trust

#### Option A: Admin-Granted Trust (Recommended)

1. Invite your first 5-10 members (people you know and trust)
2. Once they join, go to Members list
3. For each founding member:
   - Click the edit button next to their name
   - Grant 15-20 admin trust points
   - Add a note: "Founding member - bootstrapping trust"

**Why this works**: These trusted members can now:
- Award trust to each other
- Award trust to new members
- Share resources
- Create content

#### Option B: Role-Based Access

Instead of admin trust, assign explicit roles:
1. Assign "Wealth Creator" role to enable sharing
2. Assign "Trust Granter" role to enable awarding trust
3. Assign "Thread Creator" role to enable forum participation

**Trade-off**: More admin work, but more controlled.

#### Hybrid Approach (Best for Most Communities)

1. Grant moderate admin trust (10-15 points) to founding members
2. Also assign key roles for immediate participation
3. Let peer trust develop organically over time
4. Reduce admin trust as peer trust grows

### How Much Admin Trust to Grant?

**Conservative**: 10-15 points
- Enough to participate
- Still need peer validation for advanced features
- **Good for**: Cautious communities, unknown members

**Moderate**: 15-25 points (recommended)
- Full participation immediately
- Can create most content
- **Good for**: Most communities, trusted founding members

**Liberal**: 25-50 points
- Advanced features immediately available
- Founding members are community leaders
- **Good for**: Small, tight-knit groups with known members

### Reviewing Admin-Granted Trust

As peer trust develops, you can:
1. Review admin trust grants
2. Reduce admin trust as peer trust grows
3. Eventually remove admin trust entirely for organic system

**Why**: This ensures the community runs on peer validation, not admin authority.

## Step 5: Invite Your First Members

### Choosing Founding Members

Good founding members:
- Understand and align with community values
- Will participate actively
- Can help welcome and integrate new members
- Represent diversity of your community

**Recommendation**: Start with 5-15 founding members.

### Invitation Methods

#### Direct User Invites

For specific people you know:
1. Go to Community Settings > Members
2. Click "Invite Member"
3. Enter their email or username
4. Add personal message explaining the community
5. Send invite

**When they accept**: They become members immediately.

#### Invite Links

For sharing in groups or on social media:
1. Go to Community Settings > Invites
2. Click "Create Invite Link"
3. Set expiration date (7-30 days recommended)
4. Copy the link
5. Share via email, messaging, or social channels

**Security note**: Anyone with the link can join until it expires.

### Welcoming New Members

When founding members join:
1. Send welcome message explaining:
   - Community purpose and values
   - How trust works
   - How to get started (share resources, participate in forum)
   - Who to ask for help
2. Grant initial admin trust (as discussed above)
3. Encourage them to introduce themselves in forum
4. Guide them to award trust to each other

## Step 6: Seed Initial Content

Help members get oriented by creating:

### Forum Structure

1. Create basic forum categories:
   - "Welcome & Introductions"
   - "General Discussion"
   - "Resource Sharing"
   - "Community Business" (polls, decisions)
2. Create first thread: "Welcome to [Community Name]!"
3. Pin it to homepage
4. Encourage members to introduce themselves

### Initial Resource Sharing

Encourage founding members to:
1. Share 1-2 items of wealth immediately
2. This demonstrates how the system works
3. Creates opportunities for requests and trust-building

### First Community Poll

Create a simple poll:
- "What should we focus on first?"
- "What features are most important?"
- "What items do people need most?"

**Purpose**: Gets members engaged in decision-making immediately.

## Step 7: Establish Community Rhythms

### Regular Communication

Set up:
- Weekly or bi-weekly community check-ins
- Monthly community meetings (virtual or in-person)
- Communication channels (forum, external chat if needed)

### Trust Review Process

Plan to review trust system monthly:
- Who has earned trust?
- Are thresholds appropriate?
- Are admin trust grants still needed?
- How is the trust distribution?

### Feedback Loops

Create ways to gather feedback:
- Monthly survey about community health
- Open forum threads for suggestions
- Regular admin office hours
- Anonymous feedback mechanism

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't: Create a Community Alone

**Problem**: You can't bootstrap trust by yourself.

**Solution**: Have at least 3-5 founding members ready to join when you create it.

### Don't: Skip Trust Bootstrapping

**Problem**: Members join but can't do anything, get frustrated, leave.

**Solution**: Grant admin trust immediately to founding members.

### Don't: Set Thresholds Too High Initially

**Problem**: Even trusted members can't access features.

**Solution**: Start moderate, tighten only if problems emerge.

### Don't: Invite Too Many People at Once

**Problem**: Overwhelming, can't onboard well, culture doesn't stabilize.

**Solution**: Start with 5-15 founding members, grow gradually.

### Don't: Forget to Create Initial Content

**Problem**: Empty community feels dead, members don't engage.

**Solution**: Create forum threads, share resources, post polls before inviting members.

# Welcome to Communities

**Communities** is a community resource sharing platform that enables communities to manage shared resources, build trust relationships, and make collaborative decisions—all without monetary transactions.

## What is Communities?

Communities empowers communities to:

- **Share Resources**: Members share products, services, and resources with the community
- **Build Trust**: Earn permissions through peer validation and community trust
- **Collaborate**: Make decisions together through polls and voting
- **Organize**: Form councils and pools to manage collective resources
- **Track Contributions**: Recognize and value member contributions
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Transparent dispute resolution and mediation

## Core Philosophy

Communities is built on three principles:

1. **Trust-Based Governance** - Members earn permissions through peer trust, not just administrative assignment
2. **Transparency** - All actions are logged and auditable by the community
3. **Flexibility** - Communities configure thresholds and rules to match their values

# Notifications

Notifications keep you informed about community activity that needs your attention. This guide shows you how to stay updated on requests, messages, and important events without missing anything.

## What are Notifications?

**Notifications** are alerts that tell you when something important happens in your communities:

- **New messages** - Someone replied to your wealth request
- **Request updates** - A request was accepted, rejected, or fulfilled
- **Activity alerts** - Trust changes, pool distributions, and other events
- **Timely awareness** - See what needs your attention right away

### Why They Matter

In a gift economy, timely communication is essential:

- **Respond quickly** - Don't keep others waiting
- **Stay coordinated** - Know when exchanges happen
- **Track activity** - See all your community interactions
- **Build trust** - Prompt responses strengthen relationships
- **Never miss important events** - Get alerts for what matters

## Notification Types

Communities generates notifications for different types of activity:

### Wealth Request Messages

**When you get notified:**
- Someone sends you a message in a wealth request thread
- You're either the person who shared the item or the person requesting it

**What you'll see:**
- Title: "New message in your wealth request"
- Who sent the message
- Link to the request to read and reply

**What to do:**
- Click the notification to view the message
- Reply to continue the conversation
- Coordinate pickup/delivery details

!!! example "Example Scenario"
    You requested a power drill from Alice. She sends a message: "Sure! When do you need it?" You get a notification and can reply immediately to arrange pickup.

### Wealth Request Status Changes

**When you get notified:**
- As a **requester**, when the owner accepts, rejects, or cancels your request
- Status changes from "Pending" to any other state

**What you'll see:**
- Title: "Your request was accepted" (or rejected/cancelled)
- What item the request is for
- Link to view the request details

**What to do:**
- If **accepted**: Coordinate delivery through messages
- If **rejected**: Understand the owner's decision, try other options
- If **cancelled**: Request was withdrawn by owner

### New Wealth Requests

**When you get notified:**
- As a **wealth owner**, when someone requests your shared item
- Someone submits a new request for something you're sharing

**What you'll see:**
- Title: "New request for your shared item"
- Who made the request
- What they're requesting and how much
- Link to review the request

**What to do:**
- Review the requester's message
- Check their trust score and contribution history
- Accept or reject based on availability and trust
- Send a message if you need more information

!!! tip "Responding to Requests"
    Aim to respond within 24-48 hours. Even if you can't fulfill the request, a prompt rejection is better than leaving someone waiting.

### Future Notification Types

These notification types are planned for upcoming releases:

**Pool Activity** - When resources are distributed from pools you're part of

**Council Activity** - Updates about councils you participate in

**Dispute Updates** - Status changes in disputes you're involved with

**Trust Changes** - When someone awards or removes trust from you

**Poll Activity** - New polls you can vote on and poll results

## Viewing Notifications

### Activity Indicators

Notifications appear as **visual indicators** throughout the app:

**On Wealth Requests:**
- Small dot or asterisk (*) on requests with unread messages
- Shows in the Requests Panel on wealth item pages
- Appears in your My Requests page

**In Navigation (Coming Soon):**
- Badge showing unread notification count
- Example: "My Requests (3)" or bell icon with number

### Dashboard Activity Feed

Your **Dashboard** shows all recent notifications in one place:

**What you'll see:**
- Chronological list of notifications (newest first)
- Unread notifications highlighted or marked with a dot
- Each notification shows:
  - Icon based on type (message, status change, etc.)
  - Brief description of what happened
  - Who triggered it (if applicable)
  - When it happened (relative time: "2 hours ago")
  - Link to the related resource

**How to use it:**
1. Go to your Dashboard
2. Look for the "Activity" or "Notifications" section
3. Click any notification to navigate to the related item
4. Unread notifications are visually distinct

### Filtering Notifications

**By Community:**
- View notifications for all communities or filter to a specific one
- Useful if you're active in multiple communities

**By Read/Unread:**
- Show only unread notifications to focus on new activity
- Show all to review past notifications

**By Type (Coming Soon):**
- Filter by notification category (messages, requests, trust, etc.)
- Focus on specific types of activity

## Managing Notifications

### Marking as Read

**Individual Notifications:**
- Click on a notification to open the related item
- Notification is automatically marked as read
- Or click a "Mark as Read" button if available

**All Notifications:**
- Use "Mark All as Read" button
- Clears all unread indicators at once
- Optionally filter by community (mark all in one community as read)

**Automatic Read Status:**
- When you view the resource (e.g., open a wealth request with new messages)
- Related notifications are automatically marked as read
- Keeps your notification count accurate

### Checking Unread Count

**Where to see your unread count:**
- Navigation badge (e.g., bell icon with number)
- Dashboard heading: "You have 5 notifications"
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

**What counts as unread:**
- Notifications you haven't clicked on
- Notifications for resources you haven't viewed yet
- Automatically updated when you view items

### Deleting Notifications (Coming Soon)

In future versions, you'll be able to:
- Delete individual notifications you don't need
- Clear old notifications manually
- Notifications older than 90 days will be automatically archived

## Best Practices

### Staying On Top of Notifications

**Check regularly:**
- Visit your Dashboard daily if you're active in communities
- Look for unread notification counts in navigation
- Respond to messages within 24-48 hours

**Use filters:**
- Filter by community if you're in multiple
- Show unread only to focus on new items
- Mark as read after handling

**Don't ignore:**
- Unread notifications mean someone is waiting
- Timely responses build trust and reputation
- Consistent communication strengthens community

### Notification Hygiene

**Keep your feed clean:**
- Mark notifications as read once you've acted on them
- Check the unread count to ensure you haven't missed anything
- Review periodically even if you think you've handled everything

**Prioritize:**
- New requests for your shared items (others are waiting)
- Status changes for your outgoing requests (coordinate next steps)
- Messages (continue conversations)
- Other activity (trust changes, polls) as time allows

**Batch processing:**
- Set aside time to review all notifications at once
- Handle similar items together (all incoming requests, all messages)
- More efficient than responding piecemeal

## Common Questions

### How do I know if I have new notifications?

Look for:
- Badge or number in the navigation (bell icon)
- Unread indicators on wealth requests (dots or asterisks)
- Dashboard shows "You have X notifications"
- The unread count updates automatically every 30 seconds

### Why didn't I get a notification?

**Possible reasons:**
- The event doesn't generate notifications yet (some features are in progress)
- You already viewed the related resource (auto-marked as read)
- Notification was for a different user (e.g., request owner, not requester)

**Currently generates notifications for:**
- Wealth request messages
- Wealth request status changes
- New wealth requests (if you're the owner)

### Can I turn off certain notification types?

Not yet. All relevant notifications are generated automatically. In future releases, you'll be able to configure which types you want to receive.

### Do notifications expire?

**Current behavior:**
- Notifications remain until you mark them as read
- No automatic expiration

**Future behavior:**
- Notifications older than 90 days may be automatically archived
- You'll be able to delete notifications manually

### What happens when I click a notification?

**Navigation:**
- You're taken directly to the related resource
- For wealth requests: Opens the request detail page
- For messages: Opens the request with the message thread

**Auto-read:**
- The notification is marked as read automatically
- Unread count decreases by 1
- Indicator on the item is removed

### Can other people see my notifications?

**Privacy:**
- No. Notifications are **completely private**
- Only you can see your own notifications
- Even community admins cannot view your notifications

**Community context:**
- Notifications respect community membership
- You only get notifications for communities you're part of
- Leaving a community doesn't affect existing notifications

### How are notifications different from messages?

**Notifications:**
- System-generated alerts
- Tell you something happened
- Appear in your notification feed
- Link to the related item

**Messages:**
- User-written content
- Part of wealth request threads
- Appear in the request conversation
- Notifications are generated **about** new messages

!!! example "Example"
    Alice sends you a message: "The drill is ready for pickup." That's the **message**. Communities generates a **notification** saying "New message in your wealth request" that links you to see Alice's message.

### Will I get notified about my own actions?

No. Notifications are only generated for **other users**:

- You won't get notified when you send a message
- You won't get notified when you accept your own request (not possible anyway)
- Notifications are for events that require **your attention**, not events you initiated

### Can I get notifications via email or text?

Not yet. Currently, notifications are **in-app only**. Check the app regularly to stay updated.

**Future plans:**
- Email notification summaries (daily/weekly digest)
- Immediate email for urgent notifications
- Push notifications when mobile app is available

## Tips for Community Engagement

### Use Notifications to Build Trust

**Respond promptly:**
- Quick responses show reliability
- Others appreciate timely communication
- Builds your reputation in the community

**Complete the cycle:**
- Don't just read notifications—act on them
- Accept/reject requests, reply to messages, coordinate delivery
- Mark as fulfilled when exchanges complete

**Be considerate:**
- Remember someone is waiting for your response
- If you can't fulfill a request, decline quickly
- Keep others informed of delays or changes

### Stay Organized

**Daily routine:**
- Check notifications each morning
- Handle incoming requests (accept/reject)
- Reply to messages
- Coordinate any active exchanges

**Weekly review:**
- Mark all as read after handling
- Ensure no requests are languishing
- Follow up on accepted requests that haven't completed

**Active participation:**
- More activity = more notifications
- Budget time to respond if you're actively sharing
- Sharing creates coordination work—be prepared to communicate

## Troubleshooting

### I'm not receiving expected notifications

**Check these:**
- Are you logged in as the correct user?
- Is the notification type implemented yet? (See "Notification Types" section)
- Have you already viewed the resource? (Auto-marks as read)
- Is your browser blocking notifications? (Only affects future push notifications)

### Notification count seems wrong

**Try these:**
- Refresh the page (count updates every 30 seconds)
- Check if notifications were auto-marked as read when you viewed resources
- Look at "All Notifications" instead of "Unread Only"
- Some resources auto-read their notifications when you open them

### Can't find a notification I just saw

**Possible explanations:**
- You clicked it and it was marked as read
- Viewing the related resource auto-marked it as read
- Filter is set to "Unread Only"—switch to "All Notifications"

### I want to unremark a notification as read

This isn't currently possible. Once a notification is marked as read, it stays that way. You can still view all notifications (read and unread) in your feed.

# Skills & Endorsements: Community Capability Mapping

## What Are Skills and Endorsements?

Skills and endorsements help your community discover and validate each member's abilities. Think of it as a way to say "I know what I can do" and "I can vouch for what others can do."

**Skills** are abilities you add to your profile - things like "Carpentry," "JavaScript," "Gardening," or "First Aid." They're simple tags that describe what you know how to do.

**Endorsements** are validation from other community members. When someone endorses your skill, they're saying "I've seen you do this, and you're good at it."

### How This Differs From Trust

- **Trust** is general reputation - it shows the community believes in you as a person
- **Skills** are specific capabilities - they show what you can actually do

Both work together: high trust shows people believe in you; many skill endorsements show people have seen your work and validated your abilities.

## Why Skills Matter

Skills help your community:

- **Find the right person** - Need someone who knows welding? Check who has that skill
- **Build confidence** - See that Maria has 15 endorsements for plumbing before requesting her help
- **Give feedback naturally** - After someone shares something with you, endorse their relevant skills
- **Map community capabilities** - Understand what collective knowledge your community holds

## Adding Skills to Your Profile

### How to Add a Skill

1. Go to your profile or user preferences
2. Find the Skills section
3. Click "Add Skill"
4. Type the skill name (e.g., "Carpentry")
5. Click "Add"

### Skill Guidelines

**What makes a good skill?**
- Specific and clear: "Plumbing" not "I can fix stuff"
- 1-3 words: Keep it concise
- Commonly understood: Use terms others will search for
- Action-oriented: Things you can do, not personality traits

**Examples of good skills:**
- Technical: JavaScript, Welding, Carpentry, Plumbing, HVAC
- Creative: Graphic Design, Woodworking, Photography, Sewing
- Practical: Gardening, First Aid, Cooking, Childcare
- Knowledge: Spanish Translation, Legal Advice, Tax Preparation

**Skills can contain:**
- Letters and numbers
- Spaces, hyphens, and ampersands (&)
- Maximum 50 characters (recommend 2-3 words)

**You can:**
- Add unlimited skills to your profile
- Remove skills anytime
- Have the same skill endorsed differently in different communities

### Skills Are Global, Endorsements Are Local

When you add a skill to your profile, it stays with you across all communities you belong to. But endorsements are community-specific:

- Add "Carpentry" skill once → appears in all your communities
- Get endorsed for carpentry in Community A → 15 endorsements
- Join Community B → carpentry shows 0 endorsements (start fresh)

This means each community builds its own validation of your skills based on what they've witnessed.

## Endorsing Others' Skills

### When Can You Endorse?

You can endorse others' skills once you:
- Reach **trust level 10** in the community (the default threshold), OR
- An admin gives you the "skill endorser" role

This prevents new members from flooding endorsements before the community knows them.

### How to Endorse Someone

**From the member list:**
1. Find the person in your community's member list
2. Click "View Skills" next to their name
3. See their full skills list with endorsement counts
4. Click the thumbs-up (👍) button next to any skill
5. The button fills in to show you've endorsed it

**After receiving something:**
1. Confirm you received an item or service from someone
2. A prompt appears: "Would you like to endorse [their name]'s skills?"
3. You'll see their skills, with relevant ones highlighted
4. Click "Endorse" next to the skills you want to validate
5. Click "Done" or "Skip"

### Endorsement Guidelines

**When should you endorse?**
- After directly experiencing their work
- When you've seen them demonstrate the skill
- When you can personally vouch for their ability

**When should you NOT endorse?**
- If you haven't seen them use the skill
- Based on their reputation alone
- Just to be nice without evidence

**Quality over quantity**: One endorsement from someone who's worked with you means more than ten endorsements from people who haven't.

### Self-Endorsement

You can endorse your own skills! This represents self-assessment: "I know I'm good at this."

Self-endorsement adds 1 point to your endorsement count. It's a way to confidently claim competency while still inviting others to validate through their endorsements.

### Removing Endorsements

Change your mind? You can remove any endorsement you've given:
1. Go back to the person's skills list
2. The skills you endorsed show a filled thumbs-up icon and say "Endorsed"
3. Click it again to remove your endorsement

This isn't personal - maybe you endorsed before seeing their work, or you want to reserve endorsements for people you've directly worked with.

## Viewing Skills in Your Community

### Member List

The member list shows each person's **top 3 skills** (sorted by endorsement count). This gives you a quick overview:

```
Maria Silva          Plumbing (15)  HVAC (8)  Electrical (3)
Alex Chen            Carpentry (22)  Woodworking (18)  Welding (5)
Jordan Wright        JavaScript (12)  Python (10)  Database Design (7)
```

The numbers in parentheses show how many endorsements each skill has in your community.

### Detailed Skills View

Click "View Skills" or the skills button next to any member to see:
- **All their skills** (not just top 3)
- **Endorsement counts** for each skill
- **Your endorsement status** - which ones you've endorsed
- **Ability to endorse** - one-click endorsement for any skill

Skills are sorted by endorsement count (highest first), so you can quickly see what they're most validated for.

## Skills in the Wealth Sharing Flow

One of the most powerful features is **contextual skill endorsement after receiving something**.

### How It Works

1. **You request an item** - Let's say you request "Handmade Bookshelf" from Alex
2. **You receive it** - Alex delivers the bookshelf
3. **You confirm receipt** - Mark that you received it successfully
4. **Endorsement prompt appears** - "Would you like to endorse Alex's skills?"
5. **Relevant skills highlighted** - If the bookshelf item is tagged with "Carpentry" and "Woodworking," Alex's skills matching those appear first
6. **One-click endorsement** - Endorse the relevant skills immediately
7. **Natural feedback loop** - Alex gets validated for their actual work

This makes endorsements immediate, contextual, and tied to real interactions.

### Why Related Skills Matter

Admins can configure items with "related skills" - for example:
- "Handmade Furniture" → Carpentry, Woodworking, Furniture Making
- "Website Development" → JavaScript, Web Design, HTML/CSS
- "Plumbing Repair" → Plumbing, HVAC
- "Home-Cooked Meal" → Cooking, Baking

When you receive these items, the system suggests endorsing the matching skills. This:
- Makes endorsement effortless (one click)
- Ensures endorsements match actual demonstrated work
- Creates immediate positive feedback after successful sharing

## Finding People by Skills

### Manual Search

While browsing the member list:
1. Look at the top 3 skills shown for each member
2. Click "View Skills" to see full skill sets
3. Note endorsement counts to gauge validation level

### Future Enhancement

Community member search by skill is planned - you'll be able to filter the member list to show only members with specific skills (e.g., "show all members with Plumbing skill").

## Best Practices

### For Adding Your Skills

**Be honest and specific**
- Only add skills you actually have
- Be specific enough that others can find you
- Use common terminology (not jargon only you know)

**Keep it current**
- Remove skills you no longer practice
- Add new skills as you learn them
- Update when your focus changes

**Think about discoverability**
- What would someone search for?
- Use terms your community will recognize
- Avoid overly broad skills ("Technology" vs. "JavaScript")

### For Endorsing Others

**Base it on evidence**
- Endorse after you've seen their work
- Consider the quality of what you experienced
- Be genuine in your validation

**Endorse promptly**
- When the system prompts you after receiving something, take a moment to endorse
- Don't wait - your memory of the interaction is fresh
- It takes 5 seconds and means a lot to the person

**Endorse generously but honestly**
- If someone helped you and did good work, endorse them
- Don't withhold endorsements unnecessarily
- But don't endorse skills you haven't witnessed

**Diversity matters**
- Endorse various people, not just your friends
- New members need endorsements to build reputation
- Help validate emerging skills in your community

### For Community Organizers

**Set clear expectations**
- Explain the endorsement system to new members
- Encourage members to add skills early
- Model good endorsement behavior

**Configure related skills on items**
- Tag items with relevant skills (e.g., "Handmade Table" → Carpentry, Woodworking)
- This makes post-sharing endorsements natural
- Helps close the feedback loop

**Watch for patterns**
- High skills with low trust → investigate if reputation is accurate
- Low skills with high trust → member might need encouragement to share skills
- Unendorsed skills → members may need more opportunities to demonstrate

**Use trust thresholds wisely**
- Default is 10 (same as wealth sharing)
- Lower it if endorsements are too scarce
- Raise it if endorsement quality drops

## Common Questions

### "How many skills should I add?"

Add all the skills you're comfortable sharing with your community. There's no limit. 3-10 skills is common, but you might have 20+ if you're multi-talented.

The system shows your top 3 in the member list, but people can click to see all of them.

### "What if no one endorses my skills?"

- **Give it time** - Endorsements accumulate as you share and help others
- **Share actively** - The more you contribute, the more opportunities for endorsements
- **Self-endorse** - Start with 1 point by endorsing yourself
- **Ask for feedback** - After helping someone, they might not think to endorse unless reminded

### "Can I endorse someone I haven't directly worked with?"

Technically yes (if you have the permission), but it's discouraged. Endorsements mean more when they're based on direct experience. If you've only heard they're good at something, maybe wait until you see it yourself.

### "What if someone endorses me incorrectly?"

You can't remove endorsements others give you, but you can:
- Talk to them (they can remove it themselves)
- Let it be (one incorrect endorsement among many accurate ones doesn't hurt)
- Talk to an admin if it's truly problematic

### "Do endorsements affect my permissions?"

No. Endorsements show capability validation, but they don't grant permissions. Trust determines your permissions. You could have 50 endorsements for carpentry but still need trust level 10 to endorse others or access other features.

### "What if my skill name doesn't match the item's related skills?"

Let's say the item is tagged with "Carpentry" but you listed your skill as "Woodworking." The system won't auto-highlight it as related, but:
- The person endorsing can still see all your skills
- They can search (if you have many skills)
- You'll still get the endorsement if they choose to give it

Try to use common skill names that match how items might be tagged.

### "Can admins see who endorsed whom?"

The system tracks endorsements, but typically this isn't displayed publicly. Endorsement counts are public; individual endorsers usually aren't shown (though this may vary by implementation).

### "What happens to endorsements if I remove a skill?"

If you soft-delete a skill from your profile, the endorsements are preserved but hidden (soft-deleted). If you re-add the same skill later, the endorsements reappear.

### "Why are my endorsements different in different communities?"

Skills are global (across all your communities), but endorsements are local (per community). This ensures:
- Each community validates based on what they witness
- You can't import reputation from one community to another
- Local reputation reflects local contribution

3. **Educate members** - Explain the system to new joiners
4. **Grant skill_endorser role** - For trusted members below trust threshold if needed

## The Bigger Picture

Skills and endorsements create a **capability map** of your community. Over time, you'll see:

- **Who knows what** - Quickly find expertise when needed
- **Who's active** - High endorsement counts show active contributors
- **What your community can do** - Collective capabilities become visible
- **Knowledge gaps** - Skills no one has yet (opportunities for learning)

This isn't about competition or ranking people. It's about **making collective capability visible** so resources, knowledge, and help can flow where needed.

When you endorse someone, you're saying: "I trust this person to do this thing well." That simple validation, multiplied across a community, creates resilient networks of mutual support.

**Ready to start?** Add your first skill to your profile and see who in your community has skills you might need. When someone helps you next, remember to endorse their skills - it takes 5 seconds and means the world to them.

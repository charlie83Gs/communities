# Value Contributions

## What Is Value Recognition?

Value recognition is a system for making all forms of valuable work visible within your community. Unlike money-based systems that reduce everything to a price, value recognition allows communities to democratically decide what matters and celebrate the full spectrum of contributions—especially work that is traditionally invisible or undervalued.

### Why It Matters

Traditional economic systems fail to recognize:

- **Care work**: Elder care, child care, emotional support
- **Community building**: Welcoming newcomers, organizing events, conflict resolution
- **Creative/cultural work**: Art, music, storytelling, ritual creation
- **Maintenance work**: Cleaning, organizing, beautifying shared spaces
- **Emotional labor**: Noticing needs, creating safety, remembering important details

Value recognition makes this invisible work visible, giving your community a fuller picture of who contributes what.

### How It's Different

**Value Recognition vs Trust vs Access**

Your community uses three distinct but related systems:

| System | What It Measures | What It's For |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Trust** | Peer relationships and community confidence | Access control, permissions, social capital |
| **Value Recognition** | Recognized contributions to community wellbeing | Visibility, appreciation, pattern awareness |
| **Access Control** | What resources you can request | Based on trust + time, NOT value recognition |

**Important**: Value recognition units are for appreciation and visibility only. They:

- **Cannot** buy access to features
- **Cannot** be spent or exchanged
- **Cannot** be transferred between members
- **Do not** determine what resources you can request

Access to community resources is based on **trust and time in community**, not value recognition. This preserves gift economy principles—someone with limited capacity to contribute (due to disability, crisis, or caregiving) can still receive full support if trusted by the community.

## How Contributions Are Created

There are two main ways contributions get recognized:

### 1. Automatic Recognition from Sharing

When you share wealth (items, services, space) through the community platform, contributions are **automatically created** when someone receives what you've shared:

**Example:**
1. You post "Garden Tools" available to loan for 3 days
2. Another member requests to borrow them
3. You fulfill the request
4. System automatically creates a contribution for you:
   - Item: Garden Tools
   - Units: 3 days
   - Value: 3 × item value = total contribution value
   - Status: Auto-verified (system has proof)

This means **sharing is contributing**—no extra work needed!

### 2. Peer Recognition Grants

Any trusted member can grant recognition to another for contributions they witnessed:

**How it works:**
- Each member can grant up to a set number of value units per month (community configures, typically 20)
- You must include a description of what was done
- You can only grant to the same person a few times per month (typically 3)
- Recognition is effective immediately

**Example:**
```
You grant 10 units to Alice:
"Alice provided emotional support during my difficult week.
Her presence and listening made a huge difference."
```

This captures valuable work that doesn't flow through the wealth sharing system—informal help, emotional support, community building, etc.

## Viewing Contributions

### Your Own Contribution Profile

To view your recognized contributions:

1. Go to your profile or community dashboard
2. Click on "My Contributions" or "Value Recognition"
3. You'll see:
   - **Total value recognized** (last 6 months and lifetime)
   - **Breakdown by category** (what types of contributions)
   - **Recent contributions** with details
   - **Testimonials** from others who appreciated your work

### Viewing Others' Profiles

To see another member's contributions:

1. Navigate to their profile
2. Click on "Contributions" or "Value Recognition"
3. You'll see their summary (if they've made their profile public)

**Note**: Members control who can see their contribution profiles through privacy settings.

### Community Statistics

Community-wide value recognition shows:

- **Total value recognized** in the community
- **Distribution by category** (care work, material sharing, creative work, etc.)
- **Participation patterns** (how many members actively contribute)
- **Community health insights**

These aggregate statistics help communities understand patterns without creating competitive rankings.

## Granting Peer Recognition

To recognize someone's contribution:

1. **Navigate to peer recognition**: Find this in your community menu or the person's profile
2. **Choose the recipient**: Select the member you want to recognize
3. **Enter value units**: How much recognition to grant (within your monthly limit)
4. **Describe the contribution**: Write what they did and why it mattered
5. **Submit**: Recognition is granted immediately

**Your monthly limits:**
- Check your "Peer Recognition Limits" to see how many units you have left
- These limits reset at the start of each month
- If you run out, you'll need to wait until next month

**Best practices:**
- Be specific about what the person did
- Explain the impact it had
- Recognize work that might otherwise go unnoticed
- Don't use all your units on one person

## Understanding Contribution Categories

Communities use the same **item system** for both wealth sharing and contribution recognition. This means:

### Item-Based Categories

- **Services** (e.g., "Childcare", "Tutoring", "Conflict Mediation")
  - Typically measured in hours or sessions
  - Perfect for time-based contributions

- **Objects** (e.g., "Garden Tools", "Books", "Fresh Vegetables")
  - Typically measured in items, days (for loans), or portions
  - Used for material sharing contributions

### Item Values

Each item has a **value per unit** (like 10 value units per hour of childcare). These values:

- Start equal by default (all items valued the same)
- Can be adjusted by your community through democratic processes
- Reflect what your community values, not market prices
- Are reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on community learning

**Example:**
Your community might increase the value of "Elder Care" from 10 to 15 units per hour because:
- Elder care is becoming scarce
- Community has growing need
- Caregivers report high effort/impact
- Community deeply values intergenerational care

## Verification and Trust

### Auto-Verified Contributions

Most contributions are **automatically verified** because they come from trusted sources:

- **Wealth fulfillment**: System tracks the transaction
- **Peer recognition grants**: Trust-based, within limits

These don't require additional verification—they're effective immediately.

### Disputed Contributions

If there's an error in a contribution (wrong quantity, duplicate entry, etc.):

1. Either party can mark it as disputed
2. Both provide their account
3. Council or mediator reviews
4. Decision is documented

This is for **error correction**, not fraud prevention. The system is designed to trust members, with disputes handled through conversation rather than algorithmic punishment.

## Privacy Settings

You control who can see your contribution profile:

### Visibility Options

- **Everyone in community**: All members can see (default)
- **Trusted members only**: Only members with high trust can see
- **Council/Admins only**: Only community leadership can see
- **Private**: Only you can see (admins retain access for community health)

### Testimonial Settings

- Show qualitative testimonials from others
- Show only quantitative totals
- Anonymize testimonials (show content but not names)

To adjust your settings:
1. Go to Settings or Profile
2. Find "Value Recognition Privacy"
3. Choose your preferences
4. Save changes

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

**DO:**
- Log diverse contributions—not just material sharing
- Be honest and specific in descriptions
- Recognize others generously when you see valuable work
- Share testimonials that capture qualitative impact
- Remember: this is for appreciation, not competition

**DON'T:**
- Inflate contributions to game the system
- Only recognize your close friends
- Worry if you have low recognition—trust determines access
- Compare your totals to others
- Use all recognition on trying to look good

### For Communities

**DO:**
- Make invisible labor explicitly valued through item categories
- Review and calibrate values regularly based on what you learn
- Emphasize recognition over competition
- Celebrate diverse forms of contribution
- Keep access control trust-based, not recognition-based

**DON'T:**
- Create leaderboards or rankings
- Use value units for feature gating
- Let recognition replace genuine relationship building
- Import market values as defaults
- Make verification burdensome

## Common Questions

### About Access and Permissions

**Q: Do I need high value recognition to request resources?**

A: No. Access to requesting resources is based on **trust and time in community**, not value recognition. Someone with limited capacity to contribute can still receive full community support if they're trusted.

**Q: Does value recognition affect my permissions?**

A: Only for participating in the recognition system itself. You need sufficient trust to grant peer recognition or view certain profiles, but value recognition doesn't gate access to councils, pools, wealth sharing, or other community features.

### About Value and Recognition

**Q: Who decides what items/services are worth?**

A: Your community does, through democratic processes. Values start equal and are adjusted quarterly based on observations: scarcity/abundance, effort required, community priorities, and collective learning.

**Q: Can I spend or transfer my value units?**

A: No. Value units are recognition, not currency. They exist purely for visibility and appreciation—they cannot be spent, transferred, or exchanged.

**Q: What if I can't contribute much due to disability/crisis/caregiving?**

A: That's exactly why access is trust-based, not recognition-based. Low recognition is fine—trust allows you to receive support based on relationships, not transactions.

### About Gaming and Disputes

**Q: What prevents people from gaming the system?**

A: Multiple mechanisms:
- Peer recognition has monthly limits
- Auto-verification only for system-tracked actions
- Pattern detection flags suspicious behavior for community review
- Disputes are resolved through conversation
- Most importantly: recognition doesn't gate access, so gaming gets you visibility without power

**Q: What if someone disputes my contribution?**

A: Either party can mark a contribution as disputed for error correction. Both provide accounts, a mediator reviews, and the decision is documented. This is for fixing mistakes, not punishing fraud.

**Q: Can I see who disputed my contribution?**

A: Yes, disputes are transparent. The goal is conversation and resolution, not secret accusations.

### About Community Sovereignty

**Q: Why do items start with equal value instead of market prices?**

A: Because markets systematically undervalue care work, creative work, and community building. Starting equal lets communities discover what they actually value, not replicate existing distortions.

**Q: Can our community opt out of value recognition?**

A: Yes. Communities can disable the value recognition system entirely in settings. It's an optional tool, not a requirement.

**Q: Can we adjust how the system works for our community?**

A: Yes. Communities control:
- Whether recognition is enabled
- Monthly limits for peer grants
- Item values and categories
- Privacy defaults
- Verification settings

## Getting Started

### First Steps

1. **Explore your profile**: See what contributions have been automatically logged from your wealth sharing
2. **Check your limits**: See how many peer recognition units you can grant this month
3. **Recognize someone**: Find a member who's done valuable work and grant them recognition
4. **Adjust privacy**: Set your visibility preferences for your contribution profile
5. **Learn item values**: Review what items/services your community values and their current worth

### As Your Community Grows

- Participate in quarterly value calibration reviews
- Notice what types of work are showing up vs. what's missing
- Advocate for categories that make invisible labor visible
- Use aggregate data to understand community patterns
- Remember: recognition is one signal among many—relationships matter most

---

**Remember**: Value recognition is a tool for appreciation and visibility, not a replacement for genuine relationship building. Trust, not transactions, forms the foundation of community support.

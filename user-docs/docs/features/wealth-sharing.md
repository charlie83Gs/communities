# Wealth Sharing

Wealth Sharing enables you to share resources and services with your community without money. This guide shows you how to give, request, and coordinate resource exchanges based on trust and reciprocity.

## What is Wealth Sharing?

**Wealth Sharing** is Communities's gift economy system where community members:

- **Share what they have** - goods, services, skills, time
- **Request what they need** - without payment or obligation
- **Coordinate exchanges** - directly between givers and receivers
- **Build community** - through generosity and mutual aid

### Why It Matters

Traditional markets require money for every exchange. Wealth Sharing enables:

- **Resource access without currency** - Trust replaces money
- **Surplus redistribution** - Share what you don't need
- **Skill exchange** - Offer services based on ability
- **Community resilience** - Members support each other
- **Relationship building** - Exchanges create connections

## Core Concepts

### Wealth Types

All shared items fall into two categories:

**Objects** - Physical items or goods:
- Fresh produce (vegetables, fruits)
- Packaged food (grains, canned goods, snacks)
- Clothing and accessories
- Tools and equipment
- Furniture
- Electronics
- Household items
- Books and media
- Sports equipment

**Services** - Time, skills, or activities:
- Home repairs (plumbing, electrical, carpentry)
- Care services (childcare, eldercare, pet care)
- Education (tutoring, language lessons, workshops)
- Transportation (rides, moving help)
- Professional services (tech support, design, legal advice)
- Creative services (photography, writing, translation)
- Food services (cooking, catering, baking)
- Health & wellness (massage, fitness training, yoga)
- Cleaning & organizing
- Event services

### Sharing vs. Requesting

Communities distinguishes between giving and receiving:

**Sharing (Giving)** - Open to everyone:
- **No trust requirement** - Any community member can share
- **Philosophy**: Generosity builds trust and community
- **Unrestricted** - Share as much or as little as you want

**Requesting (Receiving)** - Requires trust:
- **Trust threshold** - Community sets minimum trust score (default: 10)
- **Philosophy**: Receiving requires proven trustworthiness
- **Protects sharers** - Prevents abuse from unknown members

!!! tip "Building Trust to Request"
    If you can't request items yet, participate in your community first. Share what you can, engage in discussions, and build relationships. Trust will grow naturally.

### Units and Quantities

All wealth items are **unit-based**:

- **Objects**: Single items or quantities (e.g., "5 kg of tomatoes", "1 bicycle")
- **Services**: Hours or sessions (e.g., "10 hours of tutoring", "3 massage sessions")

When sharing, you specify:
- **Units available** - Total amount to share
- **Max units per person** (optional) - Limit per requester

**Example**: Share "20 hours of carpentry" with max 5 hours per person = up to 4 people can request.

### Request Statuses

Requests move through these states:

| Status | Meaning | Actions Available |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Pending** | Awaiting owner decision | Owner: Accept/Reject, Requester: Cancel |
| **Accepted** | Owner approved the request | Coordinate delivery via messages |
| **Fulfilled** | Exchange completed successfully | None (final state) |
| **Rejected** | Owner declined the request | None (final state) |
| **Cancelled** | Request cancelled by requester or owner | None (final state) |
| **Failed** | Accepted request not completed | Requester reports unfulfilled |

## How to Share Resources

### Step 1: Access Sharing

1. Navigate to your community page
2. Go to the **Wealth** tab
3. Click **Share Resource** or **Create Wealth Item**

_[Screenshot placeholder: Community wealth tab with "Share Resource" button highlighted]_

### Step 2: Choose Item Type

Filter by what you're sharing:

- **All Items** - Browse everything
- **Objects Only** - Physical items
- **Services Only** - Skills and time

_[Screenshot placeholder: Item type filter dropdown]_

### Step 3: Select or Create Item

Choose from the catalog:

- **Search existing items** - Type to find (e.g., "tomatoes", "plumbing")
- **Browse by category** - Explore organized lists
- **Create custom item** - If you have permission to manage items

!!! note "Default Item Catalog"
    Communities start with 400+ default items across 22 categories. These are templates you can use or customize.

_[Screenshot placeholder: Item selector showing search and category options]_

### Step 4: Complete Sharing Details

Fill in the form:

**Title** (required):
- Brief description of what you're sharing
- Example: "Fresh organic tomatoes from my garden"

**Description** (required):
- Details about the item/service
- Quality, condition, limitations
- Example: "Ripe heirloom tomatoes, various colors. Pick up from my porch."

**Image** (optional):
- Upload a photo
- Helps requesters see what they're getting

**Duration**:
- **Unlimited** - Share indefinitely
- **Time-bound** - Set an end date
  - Example: Fresh produce available until Friday

**Units**:
- **Units available** - How much you're sharing (required, minimum 1)
- **Max units per person** - Optional limit per requester
  - Example: 20 kg available, max 5 kg per person

_[Screenshot placeholder: Wealth creation form with filled example]_

### Step 5: Recurrent Services (Optional)

If sharing a service, enable **Recurrent Service** to automatically replenish:

**Frequency**:
- **Weekly** - Replenish every 7 days
- **Monthly** - Replenish every month

**Replenish Value**:
- Number of units to add each cycle
- Example: 10 hours replenished monthly

**How it works**:
- System automatically adds units on schedule
- You continue offering the service indefinitely
- Perfect for ongoing commitments

**Example**: "10 hours of electrical consulting, replenishing 10 hours every month"

_[Screenshot placeholder: Recurrent service options section]_

### Step 6: Advanced Options

**Automation** (optional):
- Enable automatic acceptance based on rules (future feature)

### Step 7: Submit

Click **Share Wealth** to publish your offer.

Your shared item now appears in the community wealth list!

## How to Request Resources

### Step 1: Browse Available Wealth

1. Go to community **Wealth** tab
2. Browse or search available items
3. Filter by:
   - Type (objects/services)
   - Status (available, pending, fulfilled)
   - Trust requirement (items you can access)

_[Screenshot placeholder: Wealth list with filters]_

### Step 2: Review Item Details

### Step 3: Check Request Permissions

**Can you request this item?**

Requirements:
1. ✓ You have minimum trust score (community default: 10)
2. ✓ Item has units available
3. ✓ You meet any special trust requirements set by owner

!!! warning "Trust-Capped Items"
    Some owners set higher trust requirements for valuable items (e.g., "Car sharing requires 50 trust"). This protects high-value resources.

### Step 4: Create Request

Click **Request** and provide:

**Units Requested**:
- How much you need
- Must not exceed max units per person

**Message** (optional but recommended):
- Why you need the item
- When/where you'd like to coordinate
- Any relevant context

**Example Message**:
```
I'm renovating my spare room and could really use these tools
this weekend. I can pick them up Saturday morning and return
them Sunday evening. Thanks for sharing!
```

### Step 5: Submit Request

Click **Submit Request**.

The owner receives a notification and will respond.

## Coordinating Exchanges

### Private Messaging

Each request has a **private message thread** between you and the owner.

**Use messages to**:

## Understanding Wealth Statuses

Items can have these overall statuses:

| Status | Meaning | Visibility |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Active** | Available for requests | Visible in listings |
| **Fulfilled** | All units distributed or manually marked complete | Archived |
| **Cancelled** | Owner cancelled the offer | Archived |
| **Expired** | Time-bound item past end date | Archived |

### Automatic Status Changes

- **Active → Fulfilled**: When all units are requested and fulfilled
- **Active → Expired**: Time-bound items past their end date
- **Active → Cancelled**: Owner manually cancels

## Advanced Features

### Recurrent Services

**For ongoing commitments**:

Services can auto-replenish:
- Set frequency (weekly or monthly)
- Define replenish amount
- System adds units automatically

**Example Use Cases**:
- "10 hours of consulting each month"
- "5 tutoring sessions every week"
- "20 hours of handyman work monthly"

**Benefits**:
- Don't manually update availability
- Consistent ongoing service
- Members know they can rely on you

_[Screenshot placeholder: Wealth detail showing recurrent service schedule]_

### Trust-Capped Wealth

**Protect valuable resources**:

Owners can set custom trust requirements:
- Higher than community default
- Based on item value or risk
- Example: "Power tools require 30 trust"

**Visibility**:
- Everyone sees the item
- Only qualified members can request
- Protects both owner and item

### Sharing Targets

Items can be shared to different destinations:

**Community** (default):
- Available to community members
- Request-based coordination

**Council**:
- Direct transfer to a specific council
- Council manages from there

**Pool**:
- Instant contribution to resource pool
- Automatically fulfilled, no requests
- Pool distributes to members

!!! note "Pool Contributions"
    Pool shares are hidden from main wealth listings by default. They're managed through pool interfaces.

## Common Questions

### "Why can't I request items?"

You need minimum trust score (default: 10). To build trust:
1. Share your own resources first (no trust required)
2. Participate in community discussions
3. Engage authentically with members
4. Be patient - trust builds over time

### "Can I request from multiple people?"

Yes, you can make multiple requests:
- Different items from different sharers: ✓ Allowed
- Same item from multiple sharers: ⚠️ Generally discouraged
- Request only what you'll actually use

### "What if someone doesn't deliver after accepting?"

1. **Message them first** - Communication often resolves issues
2. **Mark as failed** - If genuinely unfulfilled
3. **Create dispute** - For serious breaches (if enabled in community)
4. **Remove trust** - If appropriate based on circumstances

### "How do I edit or cancel my shared item?"

Go to the wealth detail page and:
- **Edit**: Update description, units, or end date
- **Cancel**: Mark the entire share as cancelled
- **Fulfill**: Mark as complete when finished

!!! warning "Cannot Change Item Type"
    Once created, you cannot change from object to service or vice versa.

### "Can I charge for shared items?"

No. Wealth Sharing is a gift economy:
- No money exchanges
- No trade agreements
- No barter expectations
- Pure gift-giving based on trust

### "What are pools and councils?"

**Pools**: Community resource aggregations
- Share directly to pools
- Pools distribute to members
- Collective resource management

**Councils**: Specialized community groups
- Receive direct contributions
- Manage resources for specific purposes
- Coordinate community functions

### "How do I know if my request was seen?"

- Owners receive notifications
- Check request status for updates
- Send a polite message if no response after a few days
- Remember owners aren't obligated to accept

### "Can I see who has requested my items?"

Yes, in the **Incoming Requests** panel:

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the item I want to share"

1. Try different search terms
2. Browse categories
3. Check if similar items exist (might be worded differently)
4. If you have permission, create a custom item

### "My recurrent service isn't replenishing"

Check:
- Is recurrence enabled? (Edit your share to verify)
- Has the replenishment date passed?
- Contact community admin if issue persists

### "Request stuck in 'Accepted' status"

- Owner should mark as fulfilled after delivery
- Requester can also mark as fulfilled
- If genuinely stuck, mark as failed or contact admin

### "I shared by mistake"

Cancel the share immediately:
1. Go to wealth detail page
2. Click **Cancel**
3. Any pending requests are cancelled automatically

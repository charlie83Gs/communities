# Resource Pools

## What Are Pools?

Resource pools are community-managed collection points that make it easier to share resources between many people. Instead of everyone needing to coordinate individually, pools act as a central hub where producers can contribute and consumers can receive.

**Think of it like this:** If 8 people grow tomatoes and 20 people need tomatoes, everyone would normally need to coordinate individually (160 separate transactions!). With a pool, the 8 growers contribute to one place, and the 20 receivers get from one place - much simpler.

## Why Use Pools?

Pools solve several practical challenges:

- **Simplified logistics:** One drop-off point, one pickup location
- **Better coordination:** Council manages timing and distribution
- **Fair distribution:** Ensure resources reach those who need them most
- **Reduced overhead:** Fewer individual transactions to track
- **Transparency:** Everyone can see what's available and where it went

## How Pools Work

Pools are created and managed by councils (specialized community groups). Here's the basic flow:

1. **Council creates a pool** - Sets up the pool with rules and allowed items
2. **Members contribute** - Anyone can offer resources to the pool
3. **Council confirms** - Pool managers verify physical receipt
4. **Inventory updates** - Resources become available in the pool
5. **Council distributes** - Based on community needs, either manually or in bulk
6. **Members receive** - Resources are shared directly to members

All contributions and distributions are tracked as wealth shares, so they appear in your community activity feed just like any other sharing.

## Creating a Pool

Only council managers can create pools. If you manage a council:

1. Go to your council's page
2. Click "Create Pool"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Pool Name** - Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Community Tomatoes Pool")
   - **Description** - Explain the pool's purpose and how it works
   - **Council** - Which council manages this pool
   - **Max Units Per User** (optional) - Cap on how much each person can receive
   - **Minimum Contribution** (optional) - Smallest amount someone can contribute
   - **Allowed Items** (optional) - Which resources this pool accepts

### Understanding Allowed Items

When you create a pool, you can choose whether to restrict which items can be contributed:

- **No items specified** - Pool accepts any community item
- **Items specified** - Pool only accepts those specific items

This is useful for specialized pools. For example:
- "Fresh Produce Pool" might only accept fruits and vegetables
- "Tool Library Pool" might only accept tools and equipment

## Contributing to a Pool

Any community member can contribute to pools - there's no trust requirement for giving.

### How to Contribute

1. Find the pool you want to contribute to
2. Click "Contribute"
3. Fill in the contribution details:
   - **Item** - What you're offering (must be from allowed items list)
   - **Quantity** - How much you're offering
   - **Title** - Brief description of your contribution
   - **Message** (optional) - Any additional notes

4. Submit your contribution

### What Happens Next

Your contribution becomes a pending contribution that pool managers need to confirm:

1. **You deliver** - Bring the resources to the pool's location
2. **Council verifies** - Pool manager physically receives and confirms
3. **Inventory updates** - Resources added to pool inventory
4. **You're credited** - Your contribution is tracked in the value recognition system

The contribution appears in your wealth sharing history, just like sharing directly with community members.

### Contribution Tips

- Check the pool's minimum contribution amount
- Make sure your item is on the allowed items list
- Coordinate delivery timing with pool managers
- Include helpful details in your message (quality, variety, etc.)

## Requesting from Pools

Pools work differently than regular wealth sharing. You don't request from pools directly. Instead:

1. **Publish your needs** - Use the Needs system to say what you need
2. **Council reviews needs** - Pool managers see aggregated community needs
3. **Council distributes** - When inventory is available, they create distributions
4. **You receive** - You'll get a notification when resources are shared to you

This needs-based approach ensures resources go where they're most needed.

## Managing Pools (For Council Managers)

If you're a council manager, you have additional responsibilities and capabilities.

### Viewing Pending Contributions

Check pending contributions regularly:

1. Go to the pool page
2. Click "Pending Contributions"
3. Review each contribution:
   - Who contributed
   - What item
   - How much
   - When they submitted

### Confirming Contributions

When you physically receive contributions:

1. Verify the items match what was offered
2. Click "Confirm" on the contribution
3. Inventory automatically updates

If there's a problem (wrong item, wrong quantity, quality issues):

1. Contact the contributor
2. Either confirm with adjusted quantity
3. Or reject the contribution with explanation

### Viewing Pool Inventory

Your pool's current inventory shows:
- Item name
- Quantity available
- When it was added

This helps you plan distributions.

### Manual Distribution

For one-off distributions or special circumstances:

1. Go to the pool page
2. Click "Distribute Manually"
3. Fill in:
   - **Recipient** - Who receives the resources
   - **Item** - What to distribute
   - **Quantity** - How much
   - **Title & Description** - Notes about the distribution

4. Submit

The inventory decreases automatically, and the recipient gets a notification.

### Mass Distribution

This is the most powerful feature - distribute to many people at once based on their published needs.

#### Starting a Mass Distribution

1. Go to the pool page
2. Click "Mass Distribution"
3. **Step 1: Configure**
   - Select which item to distribute
   - Choose fulfillment strategy (see below)
   - Set max units per person (optional)

4. **Step 2: Preview**
   - See how many people will receive
   - Review the distribution plan
   - Check if you have enough inventory

5. Execute the distribution

#### Fulfillment Strategies

Choose how to distribute when you don't have enough for everyone:

**Full Strategy**
- Prioritize completely fulfilling needs before wants
- Example: 3 people need 10 units each, 2 people want 5 units each
- With 30 units: All 3 needs fully met (30 units), wants get nothing
- With 40 units: All 3 needs met (30 units), 2 wants get 5 each (10 units)

**Partial Strategy**
- Distribute up to the max limit per person
- Proportional to their needs
- Example: Same scenario with 20 units and max 8 per person
- Each person gets proportionally: needs get ~5-6 units each, wants get ~2-3 each

**Equal Strategy**
- Everyone gets the same amount
- Regardless of needs vs wants
- Example: 20 units for 5 people = 4 units each
- Fair but doesn't prioritize needs

#### Mass Distribution Tips

- Run distributions on a regular schedule (weekly, bi-weekly)
- Announce timing in advance so people know when to expect
- Use the preview to check the plan before executing
- Consider running separate distributions for different priority items

### Viewing Pool Needs

To see what your community needs:

1. Go to the pool page
2. Click "View Needs"
3. See aggregated data:
   - Which items are needed
   - How many people need each item
   - Total units needed
   - Needs vs wants breakdown
   - Current pool inventory for that item

This helps you:
- Plan which items to prioritize
- Know when to request more contributions
- Understand community demand patterns

### Pool Settings

Update pool settings anytime:

1. Go to the pool page
2. Click "Settings"
3. Modify:
   - Name or description
   - Max units per user
   - Minimum contribution
   - Allowed items list

4. Save changes

## Understanding Pool Statistics

Pools track several useful statistics:

### For Everyone

- **Total inventory** - Current resources available
- **Contribution history** - Who contributed what and when
- **Distribution history** - Who received what and when
- **Active needs** - What the community currently needs

### For Pool Managers

Additional metrics:
- Pending contributions count
- Fulfillment rate (needs met vs total needs)
- Inventory turnover
- Top contributors

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who can create pools?

Only council managers can create pools. Councils are created by members with sufficient trust (default: 25 trust score). This ensures pools are managed by trusted, accountable community members.

### Can I contribute to any pool?

You can contribute to any pool in your community as long as:
- You have basic community membership (can_view_wealth permission)
- The item you're offering is on the pool's allowed items list (or the pool accepts all items)
- Your contribution meets the minimum contribution amount (if set)

### How do I know when distributions happen?

Pools don't have built-in scheduling. The council coordinates timing externally (announcements, meetings, regular schedules). When you receive a distribution, you'll get a notification just like any wealth share.

### What if I need something not in a pool?

You have several options:
- Publish a need anyway - the council might prioritize acquiring it
- Request it directly from individuals via wealth sharing
- Suggest creating a new pool for that category of items
- Ask your council if they can add it to an existing pool's allowed items

### What happens to my contribution if it's rejected?

If a council rejects your contribution:
- The wealth share is cancelled
- Inventory is not updated
- You should receive communication about why
- You keep the resources (council hasn't received them)
- You can resubmit with corrections if needed

### Can I see who received distributions?

Yes, all distributions are transparent. You can see:
- Who received what and when
- How much each person received
- Whether it was a mass distribution or manual
- The total distributed over time

This transparency builds trust and accountability.

### How is this different from regular wealth sharing?

Pools are built on top of wealth sharing but add:
- **Aggregation** - Combine many contributions into one inventory
- **Council management** - Trusted group handles logistics
- **Needs-based distribution** - Automatic allocation based on published needs
- **Specialized focus** - Pools can target specific resource categories

Regular wealth sharing is still useful for:
- Direct person-to-person sharing
- One-time gifts
- Items not managed by pools
- When you want to choose who receives

### What if the pool runs out of something I need?

If a pool's inventory is depleted:
- Keep your need published - it helps councils understand demand
- Check regularly for new contributions
- Consider contributing yourself if you have surplus
- Look for direct wealth shares from individuals
- Ask the council about expected restocking

### Can I manage multiple pools?

Yes! If you're a council manager, you can create and manage multiple pools for different purposes. For example:
- Fresh Produce Pool
- Preserved Foods Pool
- Seeds & Starts Pool

Each pool can have its own settings and allowed items.

### How do I track my contributions?

Your pool contributions appear in several places:
- Your wealth sharing history
- Your value contribution profile
- The pool's contribution history
- Community activity feed

They're tracked just like any other wealth share, so you get credit for your generosity.

## Getting Help

If you have questions or issues with pools:

1. **Check pool description** - Pool managers often include instructions
2. **Contact pool managers** - Reach out to the managing council
3. **Ask in community forum** - Other members might have answers
4. **Review this documentation** - Make sure you understand the system
5. **Provide feedback** - Help improve pools for everyone

Pools are designed to make resource sharing easier and more efficient. The more your community uses them, the better they work for everyone.

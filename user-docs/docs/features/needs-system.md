# Needs System

Learn how the Needs System helps communities plan and coordinate resource fulfillment.

## What is the Needs System?

The Needs System allows community members to express resource requirements that can be aggregated and fulfilled collectively. Unlike wealth requests (which request specific existing resources), needs express **future requirements** that help communities plan.

## Key Concepts

### Need vs. Request

| **Need** | **Wealth Request** |
|----------|-------------------|
| Future requirement | Immediate request |
| Planning and aggregation | Direct fulfillment |
| Helps producers plan | One-time transaction |
| Can be recurring | Usually one-time |
| Aggregated by pools | Individual sharing |

**Example**:
- **Need**: "I need 2 lbs of tomatoes weekly for the next 3 months"
- **Request**: "Can I have the tomatoes you shared today?"

### How Needs Work

1. **Members express needs** - What they'll need in the future
2. **Needs are aggregated** - Community sees total demand
3. **Producers plan** - Can prepare to meet needs
4. **Pools coordinate** - Aggregate needs help pools plan distributions
5. **Needs become requests** - When resources are available

## Creating a Need

### Step 1: Access Needs

Navigate to **Community** → **Needs** → **Create Need**

### Step 2: Choose Item

Select the item you need:
- Browse the community item catalog
- Search by name or category
- Choose the specific item type

### Step 3: Specify Quantity

Enter how much you need:
- **Units**: How many units (lbs, hours, items, etc.)
- **Frequency**: One-time or recurring
- **Duration**: How long you'll need this (for recurring needs)

### Step 4: Add Context

Help others understand your need:
- **Why you need it**: Brief explanation
- **Flexibility**: Can you accept substitutes?
- **Urgency**: When do you need it by?
- **Notes**: Any additional context

### Step 5: Submit

Review and click **Create Need**

!!! tip "Be Realistic"
    Only express needs you genuinely have. Accurate needs help the community plan effectively.

## Viewing Needs

### Your Needs

View your own needs at **My Needs**:
- Active needs
- Fulfilled needs
- Cancelled needs

### Community Needs

See aggregated community needs at **Community** → **Needs**:

- **Total demand** for each item type
- **Number of people** needing each resource
- **Timeline** - when needs will occur
- **Trends** - increasing or decreasing demand

!!! note "Planning Tool"
    Aggregated needs help producers and pools plan what to produce or stock.

## Needs and Pools

Pools use needs for planning:

### Pool Needs View

Pool managers see:
- Total community needs for items in their pool
- Current pool inventory
- **Gap analysis**: Need minus available = shortage
- Future need projections

### Mass Distribution Wizard

When distributing pool resources, managers can:
- See all pending needs for pool items
- Prioritize distribution to members with active needs
- Mark needs as fulfilled when distributing

### Example Workflow

1. **Week 1**: 15 members express weekly tomato needs (total: 30 lbs/week)
2. **Week 2**: Farmers see aggregated need and plant accordingly
3. **Week 8**: Harvest begins, farmers contribute to Community Food Pool
4. **Week 8+**: Pool manager distributes to members with active tomato needs

## Needs Lifecycle

### States

1. **Active** - Currently needed
2. **Fulfilled** - Need has been met
3. **Expired** - Timeline passed
4. **Cancelled** - Member cancelled the need

### Recurring Needs

For ongoing requirements:

- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, monthly
- **End date**: When the recurring need stops
- **Auto-renew**: Creates new need instances automatically
- **Batch fulfillment**: Can fulfill multiple occurrences at once

## Trust and Permissions

### Viewing Needs

- **Default**: All community members can view aggregated needs
- Configurable with `minTrustToViewNeeds` threshold

### Creating Needs

- **Default**: Trust level ≥ 5 (or community member role)
- Configurable with `minTrustToCreateNeeds` threshold

### Managing Pool Needs

- **Requirement**: Pool manager or community admin
- Managers see needs relevant to their pool

## Use Cases

### 1. Weekly Farmers Market

**Scenario**: Community wants to plan food production

**How it works**:
- Members express weekly food needs (vegetables, eggs, bread)
- Farmers see aggregated demand (e.g., "12 families need 2 dozen eggs/week")
- Farmers plan production to meet expressed needs
- Food pool coordinates weekly distribution

**Benefit**: Reduces waste, matches production to demand

### 2. Tool Library

**Scenario**: Tool library wants to stock based on demand

**How it works**:
- Members express tool needs (drill, ladder, garden tools)
- Tool library council sees what's most needed
- Library acquires or accepts donations of high-demand tools
- Needs guide purchasing decisions

**Benefit**: Stock matches actual community requirements

### 3. Childcare Coordination

**Scenario**: Community wants to coordinate childcare

**How it works**:
- Parents express childcare needs (days, hours, number of children)
- Childcare council sees total hours needed
- Council recruits providers based on demand
- Needs help schedule coverage

**Benefit**: Adequate childcare capacity for community

### 4. Emergency Preparedness

**Scenario**: Community building resilience stockpile

**How it works**:
- Members express emergency supply needs (water, food, medical supplies)
- Emergency prep pool tracks gaps
- Community coordinates donations to fill gaps
- Needs create preparedness roadmap

**Benefit**: Community resilience based on real needs

## Best Practices

### For Members

✅ **Be honest** - Only express genuine needs
✅ **Update needs** - Cancel if circumstances change
✅ **Be specific** - Clear quantities and timelines
✅ **Explain context** - Help others understand your need
✅ **Show flexibility** - Note if you can accept alternatives

❌ **Don't over-express** - Inflated needs waste resources
❌ **Don't forget to update** - Keep needs current
❌ **Don't be vague** - "Some stuff" isn't helpful

### For Producers

✅ **Check needs regularly** - Plan production accordingly
✅ **Communicate capacity** - Let people know what you can provide
✅ **Use needs for planning** - Align production with demand
✅ **Reach out** - Contact people with needs you can fulfill

### For Pool Managers

✅ **Review aggregated needs** - Understand community demand
✅ **Plan distributions** - Prioritize active needs
✅ **Mark fulfillment** - Update needs when distributing
✅ **Communicate gaps** - Let community know about shortages
✅ **Forecast** - Use trends to plan pool strategy

### For Community Admins

✅ **Monitor needs** - Understand community requirements
✅ **Identify patterns** - Recurring unmet needs signal opportunities
✅ **Facilitate coordination** - Connect needs with capacity
✅ **Adjust thresholds** - Ensure appropriate access to needs system

## Common Questions

### What's the difference between needs and requests?

**Needs** are future requirements for planning. **Requests** are immediate asks for existing resources. Needs help communities prepare; requests access what's already available.

### Do I have to fulfill my needs through pools?

No. Needs are for planning and visibility. You can fulfill needs through:
- Direct wealth requests
- Pool distributions
- External sources
- Any method that meets your requirement

### Can I create a need for something not in the item catalog?

Yes, if you have permission to create custom items. Otherwise, ask a community admin to add the item type.

### What if my need isn't fulfilled?

Needs are expressions of requirement, not guarantees. If a need isn't met:
- Check if anyone can help
- Adjust your need (smaller quantity, different item)
- Look for alternative solutions
- Communicate with the community

### How far in advance should I express needs?

As far as helpful for planning:
- **Recurring needs** (food, services): 1-3 months in advance
- **One-time needs** (events, projects): 1-2 months minimum
- **Emergency needs**: As soon as you know

### Can I see who else has similar needs?

Yes. Aggregated needs show:
- Total quantity needed
- Number of people
- You can see individual needs (if privacy settings allow)

### What happens to expired needs?

They're archived but remain visible for historical planning. They help the community understand past demand patterns.

### Can pools auto-distribute to needs?

Not automatically, but pool managers can:
- Filter distributions by active needs
- Prioritize members with needs
- Mark needs as fulfilled during distribution

## Needs and Community Planning

### Planning Cycles

Many communities use needs for seasonal planning:

1. **Quarterly**: Members express upcoming quarter's needs
2. **Planning meeting**: Producers and pools review aggregated needs
3. **Commitment**: Producers commit to meeting specific needs
4. **Production**: Resources are created/acquired
5. **Distribution**: Resources flow to members with needs
6. **Review**: Community evaluates how well needs were met

### Needs-Based Economy

The Needs System supports needs-based resource allocation:

- **From each according to capacity**: Producers see needs and contribute what they can
- **To each according to need**: Distribution prioritizes expressed needs
- **Transparent planning**: Everyone sees community requirements
- **Efficient coordination**: Resources match needs, reducing waste

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

- **Automated matching**: Alert producers when they can fulfill needs
- **Seasonal patterns**: Predict needs based on historical data
- **Needs marketplace**: Members can offer to fulfill specific needs
- **Integration with initiatives**: Link needs to community projects
- **Needs pledges**: Commit to fulfilling others' needs

# Community Forum Guide

## What is the Forum?

The community forum is your space for open discussion, sharing ideas, asking questions, and building connections with other members. Unlike formal processes like proposals or resource requests, the forum is designed for conversation and community engagement.

Think of it as your community's town square - a place where everyone can participate, learn from each other, and strengthen relationships through dialogue.

## Getting Started

### Viewing the Forum

All community members can view forum discussions. The forum is organized into categories to help you find relevant conversations:

- **General Discussion** - Everyday community conversations
- **Resource Sharing** - Tips, tools, and helpful information
- **Events** - Planning and coordinating community activities
- **Questions & Answers** - Get help from the community

Categories are created and managed by community administrators and forum managers.

### Trust Requirements

The forum uses trust-based access to maintain healthy discussions:

- **Viewing discussions**: All members (no trust required)
- **Replying to threads**: All members (no trust required)
- **Creating new threads**: Requires trust score (default: 10 points)
- **Uploading attachments**: Requires trust score (default: 15 points)
- **Flagging content**: Requires trust score (default: 15 points)
- **Reviewing flags**: Requires trust score (default: 30 points)

You can view your current trust score on your profile page. Earn trust by participating authentically in community activities and receiving trust from other members.

## Creating Discussions

### Starting a New Thread

When you have something to share or discuss:

1. Navigate to the forum and select a category
2. Click "Create Thread"
3. Write a clear, descriptive title
4. Compose your message (supports markdown formatting)
5. Optionally add tags (comma-separated: question, announcement, idea)
6. Click "Create"

**Tips for good thread titles:**
- Be specific: "How to organize tool sharing?" not "Question"
- Front-load key information: "Potluck this Saturday - who's bringing what?"
- Keep it concise but informative

### Formatting Your Posts

The forum supports markdown formatting:

```
**bold text**
*italic text*
# Heading
- Bullet point
[link text](https://example.com)
```

Use formatting to make your posts readable, but don't overdo it. Clear writing matters more than fancy formatting.

## Participating in Discussions

### Replying to Threads

To join a conversation:

1. Read the thread and existing replies
2. Scroll to the reply form at the bottom
3. Write your response
4. Click "Post Reply"

**Discussion guidelines:**
- Read the full thread before replying to avoid repetition
- Stay on topic - if you have a different question, start a new thread
- Be respectful and assume good intent
- Quote specific parts when responding to long posts
- It's okay to change your mind based on new information

### Upvoting and Downvoting

You can vote on threads and individual posts:

- **Upvote (👍)**: This is helpful, insightful, or valuable
- **Downvote (👎)**: This is unhelpful, off-topic, or low quality

Votes help surface quality content and show appreciation for thoughtful contributions. The total vote score appears next to each thread and post.

**Vote thoughtfully:**
- Upvote content that adds value, even if you disagree
- Downvotes are for quality, not disagreement
- You can remove your vote by clicking the same button again

### Marking Best Answers

If you created a thread asking a question, you can mark one reply as the "best answer":

1. Find the most helpful response
2. Click "Mark as Best Answer"

This helps others who have similar questions find solutions quickly. You can change the best answer if a better response comes later.

## Thread Features

### Tags

Tags help categorize and find related discussions:

- **question** - Seeking information or help
- **announcement** - Important community news
- **idea** - Proposing something new
- **event** - Coordinating activities
- **resource** - Sharing useful tools or information
- **resolved** - Question has been answered

Click on any tag to see all threads with that tag.

### Pinned Threads

Administrators can pin important threads to keep them visible:

- **Category pins**: Appear at the top of that category
- **Homepage pins**: Featured on the community overview page

Pinned threads stay visible even as new discussions are created.

### Locked Threads

Sometimes threads are locked (closed to new replies):

- The discussion remains visible and searchable
- New replies cannot be added
- Usually done to preserve historical discussions or close resolved topics

## Trust-Based Moderation

The forum uses community-driven moderation rather than top-down control.

### Flagging Content

If you see content that violates community guidelines:

1. Click the flag icon on the post or thread
2. Select a reason:
   - **Spam**: Advertising or repetitive posts
   - **Off-topic**: Doesn't belong in this category
   - **Harassment**: Personal attacks or hostile behavior
   - **Misinformation**: False or misleading claims
   - **Other**: Describe the issue
3. Submit the flag

**When to flag:**
- Content clearly violates community agreements
- Spam or commercial advertising
- Personal attacks or harassment
- Dangerous misinformation

**When NOT to flag:**
- You simply disagree with someone's opinion
- Content you personally dislike but isn't harmful
- Minor mistakes or confusion (reply with correction instead)

### Automatic Actions

When content receives multiple flags (default: 5), it's automatically hidden pending review. This prevents harmful content from spreading while moderators investigate.

### Flag Review

Members with high trust scores can review flagged content and take appropriate action. Reviews are logged for transparency.

## Forum Manager Role

Communities can designate trusted members as forum managers who have additional capabilities:

- Create, edit, and delete categories
- Pin and unpin threads
- Lock and unlock threads
- Move threads between categories
- Edit or delete any content (with reason logged)
- Review flags and take moderation actions
- Access moderation analytics

Forum managers help maintain healthy discussions but work collaboratively with the community rather than as enforcers.

## Best Practices for Healthy Discussion

### Be Present and Authentic

- Share your real thoughts and experiences
- Ask clarifying questions when confused
- Acknowledge others' contributions
- Update threads if your situation changes

### Build on Ideas

- Look for connections between different perspectives
- Ask "yes, and..." instead of "no, but..."
- Explore disagreements with curiosity
- Synthesize insights from multiple viewpoints

### Create Useful Content

- Share lessons learned from your experiences
- Document solutions to common problems
- Post resources you've found valuable
- Give context when asking questions

### Maintain Discussion Quality

- Edit posts for clarity, not to hide mistakes
- Mark questions as resolved when answered
- Link to related threads to build knowledge
- Thank people for helpful contributions

### Handle Disagreement Well

- Separate ideas from identity
- State your reasoning, not just conclusions
- Ask about reasoning behind views you find puzzling
- Focus on understanding before persuading
- Know when to agree to disagree

## Common Questions

### Why can't I create a new thread?

You need a minimum trust score to create threads (default: 10 points). This helps prevent spam and ensures new members spend time understanding the community before starting discussions.

**To build trust:**
- Participate in existing discussions
- Share helpful replies and insights
- Contribute to the community in other ways
- Earn trust from other members

### Can I edit my posts after publishing?

You can edit your own posts at any time. Edits are for clarity and correction, not for erasing mistakes or changing your position after responses.

Forum managers can also edit posts if needed for moderation purposes.

### Can I delete my posts?

You can delete your own threads and posts. Keep in mind:
- Deleting a thread deletes all replies (use sparingly)
- Others may have invested time responding to you
- Consider editing to add context rather than deleting

Administrators and forum managers can also delete content when necessary.

### How do attachments work?

Members with sufficient trust (default: 15 points) can upload attachments to posts. Supported file types typically include images, PDFs, and documents.

Use attachments to:
- Share relevant images or diagrams
- Provide documentation or resources
- Show examples of what you're discussing

### What happens to flagged content?

1. Member flags content with a reason
2. After multiple flags (default: 5), content is automatically hidden
3. High-trust members or forum managers review the flags
4. Actions taken:
   - **Approved**: Content is restored
   - **Warning**: Author is notified about guidelines
   - **Removed**: Content is deleted with reason logged
   - **Restriction**: Author may be temporarily restricted from posting

All moderation actions are logged for transparency.

### Can I search the forum?

Yes, the forum supports full-text search across thread titles and post content. You can also filter by:
- Category
- Tags
- Date range
- Activity level (newest, popular, most upvoted)
- Status (open, locked, has best answer)
- Specific authors

### How do homepage pinned threads work?

Forum managers can feature up to 5 threads on the community homepage:

1. Priority determines display order (higher = more prominent)
2. Pinned threads show title and reply count
3. Visibility follows forum access permissions
4. Threads can be both category-pinned and homepage-pinned

This helps highlight important ongoing discussions or community resources.

### What if someone is being disruptive?

Use the community's conflict resolution tools:

1. **First**: Try direct communication - assume good intent
2. **Then**: Flag specific problematic posts with clear reasoning
3. **If needed**: Contact forum managers or administrators
4. **Last resort**: Use the formal dispute resolution system

The goal is healthy dialogue, not punishment. Most issues resolve through good-faith conversation.

### Can I subscribe to thread notifications?

Thread subscription features may be available (check your community's settings). This allows you to receive notifications when:
- Someone replies to threads you created
- Someone replies to your posts
- Someone mentions you (@username)
- New activity in threads you're following

### How is the forum different from other community features?

- **Forum**: Open discussion, exploration, relationship building
- **Proposals**: Formal decision-making with structured voting
- **Resource Requests**: Specific needs and offers for sharing
- **Councils**: Focused work groups with specific responsibilities

Use the forum for conversations that don't fit other structured processes. It's the "everything else" space for community connection.

## Getting the Most from Forum Participation

### For New Members

Start by:
1. Reading pinned threads to understand community context
2. Browsing recent discussions to learn communication norms
3. Asking thoughtful questions when you're genuinely curious
4. Sharing your perspectives when you have relevant experience

Don't worry about having perfect knowledge - authentic questions and observations add value.

### For Experienced Members

Support healthy forums by:
1. Welcoming new members and their questions
2. Linking to previous discussions on recurring topics
3. Modeling constructive disagreement
4. Stepping back when you've said your piece
5. Acknowledging when you've changed your mind

Your participation sets the tone for community culture.

### Building Forum Culture

Great forums don't happen automatically. They emerge from collective practice:

- **Value curiosity over certainty**: "I wonder..." more than "I know..."
- **Share reasoning, not just conclusions**: Help others understand your thinking
- **Make space for diverse perspectives**: Multiple viewpoints strengthen understanding
- **Focus on collective learning**: Everyone teaches, everyone learns
- **Embrace productive conflict**: Disagreement can generate insight
- **Know when to go deep vs. when to move on**: Not every thread needs resolution

The forum is what you make it together.

**Remember**: The forum is about connection and understanding, not winning arguments or being the most active. Quality contributions matter more than quantity. Show up authentically, engage thoughtfully, and help build the community dialogue you want to be part of.

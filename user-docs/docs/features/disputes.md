# Dispute Resolution

The Dispute Resolution system helps community members address conflicts and unfulfilled agreements through structured mediation. This guide shows you how to create disputes, participate in mediation, and work toward healing and reconciliation.

## What is Dispute Resolution?

**Dispute Resolution** is Communities's conflict mediation system where community members:

- **Name conflicts** - Bring disagreements into the open safely
- **Request mediation** - Engage trusted community members as mediators
- **Communicate privately** - Discuss issues with participants and mediators
- **Reach resolution** - Document outcomes for closure or learning
- **Maintain privacy** - Control who sees participant identities and resolutions

### Why It Matters

Conflicts are natural in any community. Dispute Resolution enables:

- **Constructive conflict** - Address problems before they escalate
- **Community accountability** - Hold members to agreements
- **Restorative justice** - Focus on healing rather than punishment
- **Shared learning** - Optional transparency for community growth
- **Trust preservation** - Resolve issues without breaking relationships
- **Mediated dialogue** - Neutral third parties facilitate resolution

## Core Concepts

### Privacy Levels

Disputes support two privacy modes to balance transparency with participant safety:

**Open Disputes** (default):
- **Participant identities visible** - Everyone can see who's involved
- **Public title and status** - Community sees the dispute exists
- **Protected details** - Only participants and mediators see full information
- **Best for**: General disagreements where privacy isn't critical

**Anonymous Disputes**:
- **Participant identities hidden** - Only visible to participants, mediators, and admins
- **Public title and status** - Community sees the dispute exists but not who's involved
- **Protected details** - Only participants and mediators see full information
- **Best for**: Sensitive conflicts requiring confidentiality

!!! note "Privacy Can Change"
    Mediators and admins can change dispute privacy type during mediation if all parties agree.

### Resolution Types

When mediators resolve disputes, they choose the resolution visibility:

**Closed Resolution** (private):
- **Who can view**: Only dispute participants and mediators
- **Purpose**: Private closure for sensitive matters
- **Use when**: The resolution contains personal details or the parties prefer privacy

**Open Resolution** (public):
- **Who can view**: Entire community (if they have sufficient trust)
- **Purpose**: Transparency and community learning
- **Use when**: The resolution sets a helpful precedent or demonstrates accountability

!!! tip "Community Learning"
    Open resolutions help communities develop shared norms and expectations. Consider making resolutions public when they might help others avoid similar conflicts.

### Dispute Stages

Disputes progress through four stages:

| Stage | Description | Typical Actions |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Open** | Dispute created, seeking mediators | Members with sufficient trust propose to mediate |
| **In Mediation** | At least one mediator accepted | Participants, mediators discuss via messages |
| **Resolved** | Mediator created a resolution | View resolution, reflect on outcome |
| **Closed** | Dispute withdrawn or cancelled | No further action (used for abandoned disputes) |

### Trust Requirements

Communities set trust thresholds to protect the mediation process:

**To Create a Dispute** (default: trust score 10):
- Ensures basic community participation
- Prevents abuse from new or untrusted members
- Low threshold - most active members can create disputes

**To View Dispute Titles** (default: trust score 20):
- See which disputes exist in the community
- Propose yourself as mediator
- Higher threshold ensures responsible mediation

**To Access Details**:
- Be a dispute participant, OR
- Be an accepted mediator, OR
- Be a community admin

!!! info "Trust Scores"
    Trust score = number of community members who have awarded you trust. Build trust by participating positively, sharing resources, and helping others.

## Creating a Dispute

### When to Create a Dispute

Consider creating a dispute when:

- **Unfulfilled request** - Someone accepted your resource request but didn't follow through
- **Broken agreement** - A community member didn't honor their commitment
- **Ongoing conflict** - You've tried direct communication but can't resolve the issue
- **Community concern** - Behavior affecting community well-being

!!! warning "Try Direct Communication First"
    Whenever possible, attempt to resolve issues through direct, respectful conversation before creating a dispute. Use mediation when direct dialogue hasn't worked.

### Step 1: Access Dispute Creation

1. Navigate to your community page
2. Click on "Disputes" in the community menu
3. Click the "Create Dispute" button

!!! note "Permission Required"
    You must have the minimum trust score (default: 10) to create disputes. If you don't see the button, you need to build more trust first.

### Step 2: Provide Dispute Details

Complete the dispute form:

**Title** (required):
- Brief, clear description of the conflict
- Keep it factual and neutral
- Example: "Unfulfilled bicycle lending agreement" not "John is a liar"

**Description** (required):
- Detailed explanation of the situation
- Include:
    - What was agreed upon
    - What actually happened
    - When it occurred
    - Why it's a problem
    - What resolution you're seeking
- Focus on facts, not emotions or accusations
- Be respectful even when frustrated

**Additional Participants** (optional):
- Select other community members involved in the conflict
- You'll be automatically added as the dispute initiator
- Only verified community members can be added

**Dispute Privacy**:
- **Open**: Participant identities visible to everyone
- **Anonymous**: Participant identities only visible to participants, mediators, and admins

!!! tip "Writing Effective Descriptions"
    Good: "On March 15, Alice agreed to lend me her bicycle for the weekend. I messaged her several times but never received it. I'm seeking either the promised loan or an explanation."

    Poor: "Alice never keeps her promises and shouldn't be trusted!"

### Step 3: Submit the Dispute

1. Review your information for accuracy and tone
2. Click "Create Dispute"
3. The dispute is now visible to members with sufficient trust

!!! success "What Happens Next"
    - Community members with high enough trust can see your dispute title
    - Trusted members can propose themselves as mediators
    - You'll be notified when someone proposes to mediate
    - You can add messages to communicate with participants

## The Mediation Process

### Mediator Proposals

**If you created a dispute**:

1. Members with sufficient trust (default: 20) can propose to mediate
2. You'll see proposed mediators in the "Mediators" section
3. Review each proposal:
    - Check the mediator's trust score
    - Consider their community involvement
    - Think about potential conflicts of interest
4. Accept or reject each proposal
5. You can accept multiple mediators if helpful

**If you want to mediate**:

1. Find disputes in your community (requires trust score 20)
2. Click on a dispute to view details
3. Click "Propose as Mediator"
4. Wait for participants to accept or reject your proposal

!!! tip "Good Mediators"
    Effective mediators are:
    - Neutral (no stake in the outcome)
    - Trusted by the community
    - Good listeners
    - Patient and calm
    - Skilled at facilitating dialogue

### Mediator Acceptance

**All participants must accept** a mediator proposal for it to take effect:

- Each participant reviews proposals independently
- When all participants accept, the mediator status changes to "Accepted"
- The dispute status changes to "In Mediation" after the first mediator is accepted
- Accepted mediators gain full access to dispute details

**Rejection**: Any participant can reject a mediator proposal, which declines it for everyone. This protects participants' safety and comfort.

### Communication During Mediation

Once mediation begins, participants and mediators use the message system:

**Message Visibility Options**:
- **Visible to participants**: All dispute participants see this message
- **Visible to mediators**: All accepted mediators see this message
- Both options can be enabled simultaneously

**Use cases**:
- Participant-only messages: Discuss among yourselves
- Mediator-only messages: Seek mediator advice privately
- Both visible: General discussion in mediation
- Neither (not recommended): Would create invisible messages

!!! example "Message Scenarios"
    - **Participant to mediator privately**: "I'm willing to compromise on timing but not the core agreement" (only mediators visible)
    - **Mediator to all**: "Let's take 24 hours to reflect before our next discussion" (both visible)
    - **Participant to participants**: "I apologize for my harsh tone yesterday" (only participants visible)

### Working Toward Resolution

**For Participants**:
1. Engage respectfully with the process
2. Listen to other perspectives
3. Be honest about your needs and concerns
4. Stay focused on solutions, not blame
5. Be willing to compromise when appropriate
6. Respect mediator guidance

**For Mediators**:
1. Remain neutral and non-judgmental
2. Create space for all voices
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Help identify common ground
5. Propose potential solutions
6. Document what's agreed upon
7. Check in about resolution type (open vs. closed)

!!! warning "Mediator Ethics"
    Mediators should:
    - Never take sides or show favoritism
    - Keep discussions confidential (unless open resolution chosen)
    - Acknowledge their own conflicts of interest
    - Step down if they can't remain neutral
    - Focus on healing relationships, not just "winning"

## Creating a Resolution

### When Mediators Can Resolve

Only **accepted mediators** can create resolutions. Participants cannot directly resolve their own disputes - this ensures neutral oversight.

### Step 1: Draft the Resolution

Navigate to the dispute detail page and find the "Resolution" section. Click "Create Resolution" and provide:

**Resolution Type**:
- **Open (Public)**: Visible to the entire community
- **Closed (Private)**: Only visible to participants and mediators

**Resolution Text**:
- Summarize what was agreed upon
- Document any commitments made by participants
- Note any acknowledgments or apologies
- Describe the path forward
- Keep it clear and factual

!!! example "Good Resolution Example"
    "After discussion, all parties agreed:

    1. Alice acknowledges she overcommitted and couldn't follow through on the bicycle loan
    2. Bob accepts Alice's apology and understands the circumstances
    3. Alice will prioritize Bob's next resource request when possible
    4. Both parties commit to clearer communication about availability

    This dispute is considered resolved with understanding reached on both sides."

### Step 2: Choose Resolution Type

Consider carefully whether to make the resolution open or closed:

**Choose Open Resolution when**:
- The situation sets a helpful precedent
- Demonstrates accountability publicly
- Helps the community learn and grow
- Participants agree to transparency
- No sensitive personal information involved

**Choose Closed Resolution when**:
- Contains private or sensitive details
- Participants prefer privacy
- The resolution involves personal circumstances
- Community learning value is minimal

!!! note "Community Settings"
    Some communities may disable open resolutions. Check your community's dispute settings.

### Step 3: Submit the Resolution

1. Review your resolution text carefully
2. Confirm the resolution type (open/closed)
3. Click "Create Resolution"
4. The dispute status changes to "Resolved"
5. Participants and (if open) community members can view the resolution

## Common Questions

### Can I delete a dispute I created?

No, disputes cannot be deleted once created. However, you can work with mediators to close a dispute if it's no longer relevant. This preserves the audit trail and maintains accountability.

### What if no one proposes to mediate?

Give it time - trusted community members may need a few days to see the dispute and consider mediating. If no proposals come after a week, you can:

- Reach out to trusted members directly
- Post in the community forum asking for mediator help
- Contact community admins for assistance
- Try direct communication with participants again

### What if participants reject all mediator proposals?

This suggests either:
- No suitable neutral mediators have proposed yet
- Participants have concerns about specific mediators
- The dispute may need admin involvement

Consider messaging participants to discuss what kind of mediator would be acceptable.

### Can I propose to mediate a dispute I'm involved in?

No, you cannot mediate disputes where you're a participant. Mediators must be neutral third parties who can facilitate fairly.

### What happens if mediation doesn't lead to resolution?

Some disputes don't reach resolution, and that's okay. The process still provides:
- Documentation of the conflict
- Structured communication attempt
- Community awareness of the issue
- Foundation for future resolution

Mediators can close disputes without formal resolution if all parties agree it's not progressing.

### How do I report an unfulfilled resource request?

When creating a dispute about an unfulfilled request:

1. Reference the specific wealth item and request
2. Include dates: when accepted, when expected, when realized it wouldn't happen
3. Describe any communication attempts
4. State what you're seeking (apology, future priority, explanation)

The dispute system tracks these patterns and helps prevent repeat issues.

### Can disputes affect trust scores?

Not directly. However:
- How you participate in disputes affects others' willingness to trust you
- Repeated disputes as a participant may signal reliability concerns
- Good mediation builds community reputation
- Respectful dispute participation maintains trust

### What if a dispute involves harassment or safety concerns?

For serious issues like harassment, threats, or safety violations:

1. Contact community admins immediately
2. Consider whether dispute mediation is appropriate
3. Admins have special tools for handling serious violations
4. Your safety takes priority over mediation processes

### Can I add participants later?

Yes, current participants and accepted mediators can add new participants during mediation if it becomes clear others should be involved.

### What's the difference between closing and resolving?

- **Resolved**: Mediation led to a documented resolution (the healthy outcome)
- **Closed**: Dispute withdrawn, abandoned, or determined not to need resolution (neutral outcome)

Both are final states, but resolved includes a resolution document.

### How do I become a trusted mediator?

Build mediation trust by:
- Earning general community trust (participate, share, help)
- Studying conflict resolution skills
- Starting with simpler disputes
- Being consistently neutral and fair
- Documenting resolutions well
- Following up on agreements

Communities often recognize skilled mediators by awarding them higher trust.
